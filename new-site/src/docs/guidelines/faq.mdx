# Frequently asked questions

Here you will find frequently asked questions about HDS and answers to those questions. If you do not find an answer to your question on this page, you can always contact the HDS team for more information.

## General

<Accordion 
  heading="What browser and browser versions are supported?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  <p>
  HDS follows the guideline of the City of Helsinki related to browser support. This means that the following browsers are officially supported
  <ul>
    <li>Chrome</li>
    <li>Firefox</li>
    <li>Safari</li>
  </ul>
  Versions 6 months old and newer are supported.

  Note: While these three (3) browsers are officially supported by the HDS, you can still report bugs and request support related to other browsers as well. HDS team will do their best to fix issues to other browsers and versions too.

<Accordion 
  heading="How is mobile first taken into account in HDS?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  HDS components and patterns are designed to be used on mobile devices right from the start. All HDS components are fully featured both on mobile and desktop screens, meaning that features are not degraded for mobile devices. 

  HDS uses two (2) methods to provide components for different screen sizes. The first method is to provide responsive components that react to the changing screen size (e.g. Navigation). The second method is to provide a separate `small` variant that can be used both on mobile screens as well as on more information-heavy user interfaces.

## Design

<Accordion 
  heading="My Abstract projects take a long time to open or save. What should I do?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  <p>
  Most often this is caused by large Sketch file sizes. Abstract recommends Sketch files to be below 50MB in size. If you files are larger than this, here are a couple of tips to reduce files' sizes:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Reorganise your files.</b> This means creating multiple smaller files from one larger file. If many of your files use the same components, create one file to hold those components and use that file as a library. Read more about creating library files in the <Link

      size="M"
      external
      openInExternalDomainAriaLabel="Opens a different website"
    >Abstract’s documentation.</Link></li>
    <li>In Sketch, use <b>File → Reduce File Size</b> feature. This uses multiple methods to reduce the file size.</li>
    <li><b>Check your images and compress them if needed.</b> Prefer .png and .jpeg file formats. Images are often the largest source of file sizes in Sketch projects.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
  heading="How to customize Sketch typography styles (for example, wants to use a font with a color that is not part of the default library)" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  <p>
  Generally, only black and white typography is recommended in the City of Helsinki services. If your project needs to use other colours (e.g. brand colours) in typography, you will quickly find out that these colour variations are not available in the shared Sketch styles and Sketch does not allow you to change the text colour without breaking the link to the original style or symbol.

  In this case, you need to create your text style and replace the default one with that:
  <ol>
    <li>Create a text element and give it a style of the same size you need. E.g. if you need a heading M size text, use heading M black style.</li>
    <li>Change the colour of the inserted text.</li>
    <li>Create a new text style of this modified text. You can do this by pressing the “Create” button in the “Appearance” side menu. Give it a descriptive name, e.g. “Heading M - 03 Bussi”</li>
    <li>Now you have a custom text style that you can use in HDS components. Just override the text style with your style in the “Overrides” side menu.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

## Code

<Accordion 
  heading="Where to get help with Drupal and WordPress?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  While HDS does not currently offer WordPress or Drupal implementations, HDS cooperates with multiple WordPress and Drupal projects in the City of Helsinki. Many of these projects have already implemented HDS components which can be reused in other projects.

  If your project is using either WordPress or Drupal, please contact ketu@hel.fi to learn about available implementations that follow HDS.

## Accessibility

<Accordion 
  heading="How HDS ensures accessibility of its components?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  HDS aims to ensure accessibility in every stage of the component development. HDS components always meet at least WCAG 2.1 AA-level and often also reach the AAA-level. Please refer to the Accessibility section for more information about this process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
  heading="Which screen readers are tested in the accessibility audit?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  HDS components and patterns are tested with the newest NVDA on Windows and the newest VoiceOver on Mac and iOS.

  On testing, the HDS team focuses more on ensuring that WCAG criteria and the HTML specification are followed properly, and not so much on individual assistive technologies. Then functionality is validated with a couple of selected assistive technologies. Different assistive technologies choose to obey standards in different ways so it is more important to follow standards than to support specific technologies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
  heading="Why JAWS is not included in the list of tested screen readers?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  JAWS is quite rare to be tested with in European countries. It is more common in English-speaking, non-European countries. JAWS also updates very often and is often incompatible with specific browser versions.

  Since HDS is fully open-source, we also promote openness in our assistive technology choices. NVDA and VoiceOver are free to use for Windows and Mac users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion 
  heading="I have an icon without a text label in my user interface. How do I ensure it is accessible?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{
    '--header-font-size': 'var(--fontsize-heading-xs)',
    '--padding-vertical': 'var(--spacing-s)',
  }}>
  <p>
  HDS recommends always having a visible text label for icons. Users interpret icons in different ways so it is important to not forget to include a text label.

  However, if your user interface for some reason includes icons that do not have a visible text label, at least ensure the following:
  <ul>
    <li>The icon includes an aria-label attribute that describes the purpose of the icon</li>
    <li>The icon SVG itself is hidden with an aria-hidden="true" attribute</li>
    <li>The icon SVG has a role="img" attribute</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
