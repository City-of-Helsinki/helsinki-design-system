## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- In the case of an insufficient password, aim to provide clear instructions to the user on how to correct the mistake. Always provide a text description of the error.
- It is required to use `autocomplete` attribute if input control is listed in the common input purposes list. You can read the full list of common input purposes at <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes" external>WCAG 2.1 documentation website</Link>. You can read more about the requirement from <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose" external>WCAG 2.1 Identify Input Purpose guideline</Link>.
- Place sign-in in its own `form` element and use `landmark` region to mark the login area. This allows assistive technologies to quickly locate and skip to the login section.
