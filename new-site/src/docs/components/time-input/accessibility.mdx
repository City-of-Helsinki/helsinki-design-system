## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **Note! `hoursLabel` and `minutesLabel` are required properties.** They improve component navigation for screen reader users.
- HDS time input allows the user to input the date manually. Whenever you require the user to input times, you should also allow the manual input.
- Be wary of automatically correcting input for the user. If this is done, the user (especially with screen readers) needs to be clearly notified about the change.
