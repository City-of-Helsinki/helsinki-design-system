## Security
As HDS password input provides only the front-end solution, remember that you need to take care of the security in your project.
Here are some good practices you need to consider.

### General Security
- Do not prevent the user from copying and pasting the password into the field.
- Prefer using ready authentication libraries and services, and familiarize yourself properly with their implementation.
- In City of Helsinki Services, always use Helsinki Profiili authentication if possible.
- Never store the password in a readable form. Always use proper hash algorithms.
- Always protect the communication with secure connections (TLS 1.2 or newer).
- Encourage usage of multi-factor authentication and password managers.

### Creating a new password
- Inform user properly what the requirements for their password are.
- Do not accept password matching user identifier, e.g. a username or an email.
- Do not truncate, sanitize, or format in any way the password user has given.
- Set minimum length for password 12 to 16 characters.
- Avoid setting a maximum password length smaller than 128 characters.
- If possible, allow the password input to reflect the strength of the password entered when the password component is used for creating anew password.
- If possible, add other programmatic assistance. Detect and suggest changes to provide the user with assistance in generating strong passwords.

### Using password to log in
- In an error message, you should not declare whether the username or the password is wrong but give general instructions to fix the problem.
