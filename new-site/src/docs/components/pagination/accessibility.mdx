## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- Each page number must have an `aria-label` to describe it. For example, `aria-label="Page 3"`.
- The active page number must have an `aria-current="page"` attribute.
- The truncation element ("..." or ellipsis) does not need to have an `aria-label`.
