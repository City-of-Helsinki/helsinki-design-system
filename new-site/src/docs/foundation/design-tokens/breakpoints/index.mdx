## Usage

HDS includes tokenized values for both breakpoints and maximum container width in each breakpoint. Breakpoint tokens can be also used alongside <Link size="M" href="#">HDS grid guidelines</Link> in order to create consistent designs and implementations.

### Principles
- Always use token of the same level for both the breakpoint and container width. This ensures consistency across all services using HDS breakpoint tokens. Read more about this in <Link size="M" href="#using-breakpoint-tokens">the breakpoint usage section.</Link>
- Aim to provide all breakpoints listed in HDS tokens in your service. This way you ensure your service is usable with every common screen width.
- For best results, test your designs and implementations at the edge of each HDS breakpoint.
- It is recommended to use scaling methods HDS suggests for each breakpoint (<Link size="M" href="#tab-1-button">see Breakpoints token table</Link>). However, it is allowed to use different scaling methods if it works better for the service.

### Accessibility
- When testing your designs and implementation at different breakpoints, pay extra attention how your service behaves if browser zoom functionality is used.

### Using breakpoint tokens
The breakpoint tokens are divided into two sets;

- **Breakpoint tokens** define exact widths (in pixels) where the next breakpoint comes into effect.
- **Container width tokens** define maximum container width in each breakpoint.

**Note how these two sets of tokens are linked.** You are supposed pick and use tokens from same level depending on the screen width. For example, when screen width is above 767 pixels and below 992 pixels you use `--breakpoint-m` token in combination with `--container-width-m` token.

**HDS offers a Container component which follows breakpoint and container width tokens automatically.** It is recommended to use it if possible.
