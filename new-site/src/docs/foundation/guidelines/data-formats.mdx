# Data formats

<LeadParagraph>
  Helsinki Design System suggests formats for commonly presented data to keep Helsinki services more consistent.
</LeadParagraph>

## Date and time

### Format
**Helsinki services are recommended to follow the Finnish date and time locale - even if the user is using some other language.** Follow these guidelines when presenting date and time in your services.

Type                            | Format                        | Notes
--------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time (forms, schedules, etc.)   | 15:00, 02:00                  | When presenting times in forms and schedules, use leading zeros and a colon separator. A 24-hour clock is always used.
Time (in text)                  | 15.00, 2.00                   | When presenting times in the written text, use a single dot instead of a colon separator. Leading zeros can be opted out as well. A 24-hour clock is always used.
Day, month, and year            | 24.6.2020                     | Date format is D.M.YYYY even if the user's locale is something else than Finnish. Leading zeros are not used for dates.
Day, month, and year (longer)   | 24. June 2020, 24 June 2020   | Using the written format of the month makes the date easier to understand for different locales. Note that technically English translation omits the dot after day number.
Today, tomorrow, yesterday      | Today, 12:30                  | If talking about today, tomorrow, or yesterday, the written format is used instead of date.
[Table 1:Recommended time formats]|

### Ranges
When presenting time or date ranges, consider making information simpler by leaving redundant month and year information out. **Note that when presenting ranges, en dash (–) should be used instead of a standard hyphen (-).**

Type                                  | Format                                 | Notes
--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time range (forms, schedules, etc.)   | 12:30–16:30                            | When presenting times in forms and schedules, use leading zeros and a colon separator. 
Time range (in text)                  | 12.30–16.30                            | When presenting times in the written text, use a single dot instead of a colon separator.
Date range                            | 2.–15. January 2020 / 2.1.–5.2.2020    | Year and/or month can be only written once if both dates share the same year/month.

### Time zones
**Automatically use the user's timezone if possible.** If not available, default to Finnish time and present the time zone as follows:

Type       | Format                          | Notes
-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time zone  | UTC+2                           | Leading or trailing zeroes are not recommended to be used for timezones.
Time       | 15:00 UTC+2                     | -
Date       | 24. June 2020, 15:30 UTC+2      | -
