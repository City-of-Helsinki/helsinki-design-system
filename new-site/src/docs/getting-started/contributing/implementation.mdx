# Contributing to the implementation

<LeadParagraph>
    Ready made components are what make HDS tick. You can contribute to HDS React and Core libraries by proposing new implementations and bugfixes to existing components.
</LeadParagraph>

When contributing for implementation, create a <Link size="M" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" external>pull request</Link> to the <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system" external>HDS GitHub repository</Link>.

### Guidelines for implementation
- HDS follows dev.hel.fi frontend coding standards: <Link size="M" href="https://dev.hel.fi/coding-standards#frontend-code-standards" external>Frontend coding standards</Link> 

#### General guides
- Do not merge the pull request after it is accepted. The HDS team will merge it. Merging the PR has a side-effect that will update the documentation site. 
- Remember to apply <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/packages/design-tokens/tokens" external>HDS Design tokens package</Link> when creating a component. Instead of specifying pixel values, colours, fonts, or breakpoints by yourself, apply those from design tokens instead 
- Take a look at <Link size="M" href="https://dev.hel.fi/" external>Develop with Helsinki site</Link> for practical details for developing open source code for the City of Helsinki. 

#### HDS Technologies

- HDS React and HDS Core both apply the <Link size="M" href="https://storybook.js.org/" external>Storybook library</Link> 
- HDS React is built with Typescript and SASS 
- HDS Core is built with pure JS and CSS 
- HDS applies yarn as its dependency manager 
- HDS applies git for version control with <Link size="M" href="https://git-lfs.github.com/" external>GIT-LFS support</Link> 

#### Creating a new component

- Apply the Scaffolding yarn script when creating a new component: <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/package.json#L17" external>Scaffolding</Link> 
- For simple components, create both versions, HDS Core and HDS React.
  Create common styles to HDS core that you can then import to HDS React like in <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/textInput/TextInput.module.css" external>this example</Link>.
  HDS React has HDS Core as its dependency.
 
- Add ready components to <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/rollup.config.js" external>rollup.config.js</Link> 

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for each component. Test rendering, accessibility, and possible functionality of the component. HDS applies <Link size="M" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</Link> for unit testing. Example of unit tests can be found here: <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/numberInput/NumberInput.test.tsx" external>Number input unit tests</Link>
- HDS applies <Link size="M" href="https://loki.js.org/" external>Loki</Link> for visual regression testing. Loki is integrated with Storybook. Hence it's important to add a story for each different UI state of the component 
- It is a good idea to test the component independently in a fresh <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/hds-cra" external>Create React App</Link>
