<Accordion 
  heading="How is mobile first taken into account in HDS?" 
  headingLevel="3" 
  theme={{

  HDS components and patterns are designed to be used on mobile devices right from the start. All HDS components are fully featured both on mobile and desktop screens, meaning that features are not degraded for mobile devices. 

  HDS uses two (2) methods to provide components for different screen sizes. The first method is to provide responsive components that react to the changing screen size (e.g. Navigation). The second method is to provide a separate `small` variant that can be used both on mobile screens as well as on more information-heavy user interfaces.
