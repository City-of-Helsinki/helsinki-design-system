  While HDS does not currently offer WordPress or Drupal implementations, HDS cooperates with multiple WordPress and Drupal projects in the City of Helsinki. Many of these projects have already implemented HDS components which can be reused in other projects.

  If your project is using either WordPress or Drupal, please contact ketu@hel.fi to learn about available implementations that follow HDS.
