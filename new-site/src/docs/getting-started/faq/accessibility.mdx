  HDS aims to ensure accessibility in every stage of the component development. HDS components always meet at least WCAG
  2.1 AA-level and often also reach the AAA-level. Please refer to the Accessibility section for more information about
  this process.

  HDS components and patterns are tested with the newest NVDA on Windows and the newest VoiceOver on Mac and iOS.


On testing, the HDS team focuses more on ensuring that WCAG criteria and the HTML specification are followed properly, and not so much on individual assistive technologies. Then functionality is validated with a couple of selected assistive technologies. Different assistive technologies choose to obey standards in different ways so it is more important to follow standards than to support specific technologies.

  JAWS is quite very to be tested within European countries. It is more common in English-speaking, non-European countries. JAWS also updates very often and is often incompatible with specific browser versions.


Since HDS is fully open-source, we also promote openness in our assistive technology choices. NVDA and VoiceOver are free to use for Windows and Mac users.

  <p>
  HDS recommends always having a visible text label for icons. Users interpret icons in different ways so it is important to not forget to include a text label.


However, if your user interface for some reason includes icons that do not have a visible text label, at least ensure the following:

  <ul>
    <li>The icon includes an aria-label attribute that describes the purpose of the icon</li>
    <li>The icon SVG itself is hidden with an aria-hidden="true" attribute</li>
    <li>The icon SVG has a role="img" attribute</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
