Reading this article will help you understand what you should consider and take into account when you migrate your project to the HDS 2.0. If you are looking for a general overview of changes in version 2.0, please refer to our [What is HDS 2.0 page](/getting-started/hds-2.0/what-is-hds-2.0).

    <li>Check your tests to see if any of the visual changes have caused them to break</li>

Before updating, we recommend to take a look at the [What is HDS 2.0 page](/getting-started/hds-2.0/what-is-hds-2.0) and <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases/tag/v2.0.0" external>the official 2.0 changelog</Link>. Pay extra attention to the "Breaking changes" section of the changelog. This helps you to get an understanding of what has been changed and what kind of effects updating may have in the implementation.

Start the migration process by updating your project's libraries to the newest HDS version. After this, keep reading below to get familiar with all major changes and how you may need to react to those.

### Changes to component APIs

There are only a few breaking API changes in the HDS 2.0. 

First, we have removed two (2) theme properties. These variables are not available for customisation anymore.

| Component         | Removed theme variable        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Accordion]()     | `--button-border-color-hover` |
| [Table]()         | `--header-background-color`   |
[Table 1:Removed theme variables]|

Secondly, there has been one change to a React component's API. The default value of the Link component's property `size` has been changed from `S` to `M`. If you have used the Link component with the default size, from now on you need to specify that explicitly by using the property `size="S"`.

### Visual changes to components

Due to the typography change, most of the components have gotten minor visual changes. While these changes are very small, it is good to note that the changes may break your project's regression tests. 


## Designers

<Notification label="A summary for designers" className="siteNotification">
  <ol>
    <li>Get familiar with the visual changes by reading the 2.0 release posts</li>
    <li>Update to the newest HDS libraries in each of your project's Sketch files</li>
  </ol>
</Notification>

Before updating, we recommend to take a look at the [What is HDS 2.0 page](/getting-started/hds-2.0/what-is-hds-2.0) and <Link size="M" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases/tag/v2.0.0" external>the official 2.0 changelog</Link>. This helps you to get an understanding of what has been changed and what kind of effects updating may have on your design files.

The newest stable HDS version is always available as an Abstract shared library. If you have already included HDS Sketch libraries in your project, all you need to do is to go to each Sketch file of your project and update libraries to the newest version. If you need help with this process, please refer to our [Abstract tutorial page](/getting-started/tutorials/abstract-tutorial#how-to-update-hds-libraries). Note that because typography styles have changed, most of the components will get minor visual changes when you update libraries.
