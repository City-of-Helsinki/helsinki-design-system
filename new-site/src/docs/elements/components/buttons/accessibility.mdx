## Buttons Accessibility

### Principles

- **Buttons are used to trigger an action.** Be cautious when using buttons for navigating. In most cases, you should prefer links for this purpose.
- Button label should always describe the action that the buttons is going to trigger. A good practice is to start the label with a verb and use two-word labels at maximum.
- Use provided button types to control the visual priority of the view. Priority of the button types is the following: _Primary -> Secondary -> Supplementary_.
- In mobile screen sizes, use full-width buttons. In other sizes use buttons that scale according to their content.
- Try to keep the amount of buttons in one view low. If there is a need for several actions in one view, consider using the smaller button variant.

### Accessibility

- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to <Link size="M" href="/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</Link> to ensure accessibility.
- In most cases, prefer using normal size buttons over small buttons. Default sized buttons are easier for users to notice and press.
- Pay attention to the button role. If you use the button as a link instead of an action (i.e. the button press causes a page load), you must specify a `role="link"` attribute to the button.
- HDS Buttons (even the Small variant) comply with <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size" external>WCAG 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA) guideline</Link>. Customizing button sizes is not recommended.
