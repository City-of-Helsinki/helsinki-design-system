# Buttons

## Usage & variations

### Primary button

A Primary button is reserved for the most important action on the screen. Primary action is usually either mandatory or essential for the user. Primary buttons are designed to clearly highlight the most important action, and therefore you should avoid having multiple primary buttons on one screen. For less important actions, consider using secondary or supplementary buttons instead.

<StatusLabel type="info">Stable</StatusLabel>
<StatusLabel type="success" style={{ marginLeft: 'var(--spacing-xs)' }}>
  Accessible
</StatusLabel>

Buttons are meant to make actions easily visible and understandable to the user. HDS offers different kinds of button variations which each suit for different needs.
