import { Checkbox, Card, Button, Accordion } from 'hds-react';
import { IconAngleRight, IconShare, IconTrash } from 'hds-react';
import Playground from '../../../../components/Playground';

## Usage

### Example
<Checkbox label="Checkbox" id="checkbox" />

## Principles
- If the user can only select one option from a list, use [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- Checkbox label should always clearly describe what will happen if the specific option is chosen. A good practice is to keep labels a maximum of three words long.
- Checkboxes work independently from each other. This means that checking one option should never affect other checkboxes.
- If Checkboxes are related to each other, use [HDS Selection group](/components/selection-group) to achieve that. 
- Checkboxes should not have any immediate effects. The checkbox selection takes effect when the user presses a submit button (e.g. in a form). If you need the selection to have an immediate effect, use [HDS Toggle button component](/components/toggle) instead. Also see [guidelines for choosing between radio buttons, checkboxes, and toggles.](/guidelines/checkboxes-radiobuttons-toggles)

### Variations

### Checkbox with label


---

### Checkbox group
Related checkboxes can be grouped together with the Selection group component. See [HDS Selection group page](/components/selection-group) for full documentation.

### Using with other HDS components
Custom Cards can be easily built by using other HDS components and typography inside the Card.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
