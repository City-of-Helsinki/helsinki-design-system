## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colors, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- When multiple Checkboxes are related to each other, group them together using [HDS Selection group](/components/selection-group). Selection group also includes a title for the group.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
