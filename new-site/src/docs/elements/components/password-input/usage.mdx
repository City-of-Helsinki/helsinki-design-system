import { PasswordInput } from 'hds-react';
import { Link } from 'hds-react';

## Usage

### Example
<PasswordInput
  concealPasswordButtonAriaLabel="Hide password"
  helperText="Assistive text"
  id="input1"
  includeShowPasswordButton
  label="Password"
  revealPasswordButtonAriaLabel="Show password"
  required
  style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
/>

### Principles
- A label should always be provided with password fields.
- If possible, validate input in client-side real-time and provide the user with immediate feedback. See [HDS Form validation pattern page](/patterns/form-validation) for more information and best practices with password fields.
- Password fields should always be mandatory. It is recommended to mark it as a required field.
- Verify that "paste" functionality, browser password helpers, and external password managers are allowed for the input.
- HDS password input provides a way to mask/unmask the password. Do not disabled this functionality without a good reason.

### Variations

#### Default
A default HDS password input includes an icon to mask and unmask the password.

<PasswordInput
  concealPasswordButtonAriaLabel="Hide password"
  helperText="Assistive text"
  id="input2"
  includeShowPasswordButton
  label="Password"
  revealPasswordButtonAriaLabel="Show password"
  required
  style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
/>

#### With an external button
If necessary, the mask/unmask icon can be removed and the feature controlled with an external button element.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
