## Usage

### Example
TODO

### Principles
- If the user can select more than one option from a list, use [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) instead.
- Radio button label should always clearly describe what will happen if the specific option is chosen. A good practice is to keep labels a maximum of three words long.
- It is recommended to have a default option checked for radio button groups Radio button groups.
- When there are more than 4 options, consider switching to [dropdown](/components/dropdown) component.
- If the choices are not mutually exclusive, use [HDS Checkbox](/components/checkbox) component instead. Also see [guidelines for choosing between radiobuttons, checkboxes, and toggles.](/guidelines/checkboxes-radiobuttons-toggles)
- If Radio buttons are related to each other, use [HDS Selection group](/components/selection-group) to achieve that.
