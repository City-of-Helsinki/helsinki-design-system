## Usage

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo language="fi" size="medium" />
</PlaygroundPreview>

The logo is used to identify the site or application as an official City of Helsinki service.
See the <Link size="M" href="/elements/visual-assets/logo">logo visual asset documentation</Link> for more information about principles of using the City of Helsinki logo.

### Principles

- Logo is automatically included in HDS Navigation and HDS Footer (not yet released) components. **Use the Logo component sparingly in other parts of the service.**
- **You should include the service name next to the logo.** This helps the user more easily identify which city service they are currently using.
- HDS Logo component includes translations for both Finnish and Swedish. **Use translation depending on the locale the user has chosen.** Swedish and Scandinavian languages use the `sv` variant while other languages use `fi` variant.
- The Logo component should act as a link to the main page of the service.
- This component is solely for the City of Helsinki logo. Do not use this component for logos of other parties.

### Variations

#### Default

The Helsinki logo component is offered in three (3) languages.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo language="fi" size="medium" />
  <br />
  <Logo language="sv" size="medium" />
  <br />
  <Logo language="ru" size="medium" />
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Sizes

The component includes three (3) size variants to fit the context.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo language="fi" size="small" />
  <br />
  <Logo language="fi" size="medium" />
  <br />
  <Logo language="fi" size="large" />
</PlaygroundPreview>
