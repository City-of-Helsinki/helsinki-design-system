import { Logo } from 'hds-react';
import { Link } from 'hds-react';

## Usage

### Example
<LoadingSpinner />

The loading spinner do not provide details about nature of the processing but it reassures the user that their action is being processed.

### Principles
- Logo is automatically included in HDS Navigation and HDS Footer (not yet released) components. **Use the Logo component sparingly in other parts of the service.**
- **You should include the service name next to the logo.** This helps the user more easily identify which city service they are currently using.
- HDS Logo component includes translations for both Finnish and Swedish. **Use translation depending on the locale the user has chosen.** Swedish and Scandinavian languages use the `sv` variant while other languages use `fi` variant.
- The Logo component should act as a link to the main page of the service.
- This component is solely for the City of Helsinki logo. Do not use this component for logos of other parties.

### Variations

#### Default
The Helsinki logo component is offered in three (3) languages.
<>
  <Logo language="fi" size="medium" />
  <br />   
  <Logo language="sv" size="medium" />
  <br /> 
  <Logo language="ru" size="medium" />
</>

#### Sizes
The component includes three (3) size variants to fit the context.
<>
  <Logo language="fi" size="small" />
  <br />   
  <Logo language="fi" size="medium" />
  <br /> 
  <Logo language="fi" size="large" />
</>

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
