## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- HDS Footer is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing the footer link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
