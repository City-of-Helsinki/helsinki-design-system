## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- While dragging and dropping files is not considered to be accessible, HDS will always include the default input below the drag and drop area. Clicking the drag and drop area also opens the device-specific file browser.
- For selecting files, HDS utilises the file browser native to the user's device. While all devices' file browsers do not have the best accessibility features, they are often the most familiar way of selecting files for the user.
