## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- The TabPanel must appear right below the TabList in the DOM tree. This means that the next focusable element after the TabList will be the tab's content.
- While HDS Tabs are accessible, you must ensure that the content displayed in the TabPanel is also accessible.
- HDS Tabs use manual activation. This means that when using tabs with a keyboard, each tab must be separately activated with Enter/Space, and they do not activate automatically. If you are creating custom tabs for your project, follow the same control scheme.
