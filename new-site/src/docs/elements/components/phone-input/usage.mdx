## Usage

### Example
<PhoneInput
   defaultValue="0451234567"
   helperText="Assistive text"
   label="Phone number"
   style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
/>

### Principles
- **A label should always be provided with a phone number input.**
    - Make sure that the label is clear and concise. The user should immediately understand what phone number they are supposed to input.
- If a specific phone number format is required, describe the format in the assistive text. 
    - Generally it is recommended to allow all common formats and fix the format automatically for the user if needed.
- Unless you can fill the input for the user automatically, a default value should not be set.
    - A placeholder text is often not used either. If a placeholder is used, it is a good practice to make them easily distinguishable from the actual input. A recommended way to do this is to format the placeholder text like this: "_E.g. 0401234567_".
- If a country code must be inputted, a separate [HDS Combobox input](/components/dropdown#combobox-single-selection) should be used alongside the phone number input.

### Variations

#### Default
A default variant of the phone number input.

Note! A default value is used here for demonstration purposes. It should not be used unless the input can be automatically filled for the user.

<PhoneInput
   defaultValue="0451234567"
   helperText="Assistive text"
   label="Phone number"
   style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
/>

#### With a country code selection
If a country code is a required input (or otherwise critical), it should be asked in a separate input using [HDS Combobox](/components/dropdown#combobox-single-selection). 

These two input are linked together using a fieldset title and `aria-desribedby` attribute. This way is is clear for screen readers which phone number these two inputs relate to.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
