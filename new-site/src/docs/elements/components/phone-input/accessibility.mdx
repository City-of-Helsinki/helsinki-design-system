## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- HDS Phone number input supports HTML input `pattern` attribute. It can be used to specify an exact format for the phone number.
    - **Note that pattern is not visible to regular users in any way.** Some of the screen readers informs the user if the input does not match the pattern. This attribute mostly increases user experience for screen reader users. 
- If multiple phone numbers are asked in the same view, make sure they are labelled descriptively or have an extra fieldset label linked to the input with `aria-desribedby`.
    - You can view an example of this below in [phone input with a country code selection variant](#with-a-country-code-selection)

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
