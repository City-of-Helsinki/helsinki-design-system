## Usage

### Example
TODO

### Principles
- Currently, Selection group can contain either Checkboxes or Radio buttons.
  - If the user can select more than one option from a list, use [checkboxes](/components/checkbox).
  - If the user can only select one option from a list, use [radio buttons](/components/radio-button).
- **Default option must be set for Radio button groups.** For Checkbox groups, this is recommended.
- Visible label must be given to the Selection group. The label should be clear and describe the choice the user is about to make.
- Selection group can be aligned both vertically and horizontally. **Vertical alignment is recommended.** Horizontal alignment can be used when there are less than 4 options.
  -  Note that horizontal Selection groups must not span to multiple lines.

### Variations

#### Vertical group
Vertical selection group is the recommended way to present grouped form controls. Vertical checkbox groups are generally easier to perceive and read.

TODO

#### Horizontal group
Horizontal selection group can be used in situations where there are only a few (less than 4) options. Otherwise, a vertical alignment is recommended.
