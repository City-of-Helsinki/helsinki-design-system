## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Aim to make the order of Selection group options as intuitive as possible for assistive technologies. This depends on the group content. An alphabetical ordering is a good starting point, but for some content it can be possible to order them by size (smaller to larger), etc.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
