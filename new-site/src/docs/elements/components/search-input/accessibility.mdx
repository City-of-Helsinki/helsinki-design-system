## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Provide descriptive aria labels for the search and clear buttons.
- If loading suggestions takes a while, the implementation automatically includes a loading spinner. In this case, remember to provide labels for both the loading and loading finished event.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
