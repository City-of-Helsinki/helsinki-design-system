## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Card must have either a visual heading or `aria-label` as a title. This describes the Card's content for assistive technologies.
- If you use buttons in your cards, pay attention to the button role. If you use the button as a link instead of an action (i.e. the button press causes a page load), you must specify a `role="link"` attribute to the button.
- The colour contrast between the Card and its background must comply with <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>WCAG AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. If needed, you may use a Card border to increase the contrast to its background.
