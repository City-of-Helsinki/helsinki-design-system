## Usage

### Example
<DateInput 
  helperText="Use format D.M.YYYY"
  id="date"
  initialMonth={new Date()}
  label="Choose a date"
  language="en"
  onChange={function noRefCheck(){}}
  required
/>

### Principles
- **A label should always be provided with dropdowns.** Aim for labels that are short, concise and easy to understand.
- Dropdowns usually have four (4) or more options. When having only 2-3 options, it is usually better to use [radio buttons](/components/radio-button "Radio button documentation") or [checkboxes](/components/checkbox "Checkbox documentation"). Also, if options need to be easily comparable (for example, product pricing), prefer radio buttons over dropdown.
- It is recommended to set a default option for a single selection dropdown. If the default option is also the recommended option, you can mark the option with a text "_(recommended)_".
- If your dropdown has 8 or more options, consider using the [Combobox](#combobox-single-selection) variant which offers filtering options by typing.
- Try to avoid dropdown options that span over one line. Aim for short texts for all options.
- If possible, do input validation client-side in real-time and provide the user with immediate feedback after selection.

#### Should I use Select or Combobox?
- **Use Select variant when**
  - there are less than 8 options
  - the user does not need to be able to filter options by typing
- **Use Combobox variant when**
  - there are 8 or more options
  - the user needs to be able to filter options by typing

#### Icon or no icon?
- **Use an icon when**
  - there is a clear added value to using an icon
  - when the icon is not just for illustrative purposes
  - when you can add an icon to all select and combobox elements in the formgroup to maintain consistency
