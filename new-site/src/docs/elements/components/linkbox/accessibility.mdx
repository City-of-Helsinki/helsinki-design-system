## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Linkbox must have the link as its last element (in the DOM tree). This way assistive technologies will eventually find the Linkbox link.
- The colour contrast between the Linkbox and its background must comply with <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>WCAG AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. If needed, you may use a Linkbox border to increase the contrast to its background.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
