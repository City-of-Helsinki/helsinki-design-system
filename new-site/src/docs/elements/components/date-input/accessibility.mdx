## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- HDS date input allows the user to input the date manually without using the date picker. Whenever you require the user to input dates, you should also allow manual input.
- If your date picker includes dates that are disabled, make sure to describe this in the assistive text. The user must understand why some of the dates are disabled and some are not.
    - E.g. "_Appointments are only possible during weekdays._"

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
