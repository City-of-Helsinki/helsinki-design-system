## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- For icons that do not have a visual text label but are important must be given a text alternative using the WAI-ARIA definition `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. See <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives" external>WCAG 2.1 Text Alternatives guideline</Link> for more information.
- If the icon has a visual text label associated with it, the icon can be hidden from assistive technologies with `aria-hidden="true"`. It prevents screenreaders repeating the same information twice (visual text followed by the icon description).
- If the icon is only decorative, it should always be hidden from assistive technologies with `aria-hidden="true"`.
- The colour contrast between the icon and its background must comply with <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>AA Level contrast ratios</Link>.
