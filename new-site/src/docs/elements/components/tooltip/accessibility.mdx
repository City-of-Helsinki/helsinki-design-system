## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Even though HDS Tooltip does not include a visual title, one must be included for screen readers via using `aria-label`. The label can be as simple as "Info" but it can also feature more detailed description such as "More information about filling your personal details".
- If a Tooltip contains a link, always open them to a new window, so that the process of filling the form is not interrupted.
- Do not make the tooltip open on hover. The user should be able to select the text inside the tooltip element.
