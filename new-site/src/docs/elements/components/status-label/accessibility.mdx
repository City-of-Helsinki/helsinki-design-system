## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- Remember that colour should never be the only way of conveying information. Make sure the meaning of the status label is clearly described by the label text. Refer to <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html" external>WCAG 2.1 Use of Color guideline</Link> for more information.
