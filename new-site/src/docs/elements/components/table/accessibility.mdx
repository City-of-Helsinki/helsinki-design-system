## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- No matter how well tables are implemented, they are always very demanding for assistive technology users. Always consider whether the table is necessary to present the information.
- Make sure your table has a heading that describes the table’s purpose. This heading can either be a heading tag (e.g. H2) or a caption element. If it is a heading tag, reference it with an `aria-labelledby` attribute in the `<table>` tag.
- Table header is read to assistive technologies on every cell. Keep table header labels short and concise and make sure they describe the data contained in table cells.
  - This is especially important if the column allows sorting. The sorting label (e.g. "First name, sorted") will be read to assistive technologies on every cell. Only allow sorting if it is really necessary and beneficial to the user.
- If your table includes empty column header cells, make sure they have a `role=“presentation”` attribute.
