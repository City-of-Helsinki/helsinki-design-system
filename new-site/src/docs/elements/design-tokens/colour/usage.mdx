## Usage

Colour can be used for branding, providing visual hierarchy and giving visual cues for action.

The Helsinki Design system colour tokens are based on the City of Helsinki brand colour palette. More information on using and combining the brand colours in the <Link size="M" href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/colours/" external>City of Helsinki Visual Identity Guidelines - Colours</Link>.

Also see visual "Do and Don't" example images in the <Link size="M" href="https://share.goabstract.com/30c40134-681b-4f96-9dfc-ee6d32c2f1eb" external>Colour usage examples - Abstract collection</Link>. These images will help you understand where brand colours and their variants can be used.

### Principles
- **Use bold colours to attract users attention** to most important content and primary actions.
- **Use lighter hues and shades to fade less important information to the background** but be sure to maintain an accessible colour contrast.
- Colour can also be used to differentiate sections or content types.

### Usage
The design system uses a colour theme that includes:
- **Primary colour:** the colour displayed most frequently across your service and its components. If you are not using a secondary colour, your primary colour can also be used to accent elements.
- **Secondary and Tertiary colours:** these provide more ways for accenting select UI elements and distinguishing your service. The secondary and tertiary colours should be applied sparingly and with intent.
- **UI colours:** the common colours for feedback (error, warning, success, info).
- **Grayscale:** neutral colour shades.

The colour palette also provides lighter and darker variants for the base colours.
- **Do not use light and dark variants as the main colour of a page.**
- Light and dark variants should only be used in addition to base colours for theming UI component states and differentiating information types.

#### Customising colours
Colours are defined as <Link size="M" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var" external>CSS variables</Link> and the theme is therefore customisable.

**When customising colours always check that:**
1. the colour combination follows the <Link size="M" href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/colours/#safe-color-combinations" external>City of Helsinki Visual Identity Guidelines - Safe color combinations</Link>
2. the colour contrast is compliant with <Link size="M" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>WCAG 2.1 Standard at AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. Note that font size affects the contrast criteria of text elements. You can find tools for checking contrast accessibility in the <Link size="M" href="/resources"> Resources page</Link>

### HDS colours

#### Brand colours
Brand colours are used for primary, secondary and tertiary colours. They should not be used for indicating system status. 

Before using Dark and Light brand colour variants, please see example images in the <Link size="M" href="https://share.goabstract.com/30c40134-681b-4f96-9dfc-ee6d32c2f1eb" external>Colour usage examples - Abstract collection</Link>.
