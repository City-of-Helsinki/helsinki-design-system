## Features

- **Accessibility baked-in** – All HDS components are from the ground up designed to be as accessible as possible. Components go through a third-party accessibility audit before release.
- **React & CSS** – Components are available both as React and CSS styles. Choose the one which suits the best for your project.
- **Customizable** – HDS components are designed to be customizable to allow expressing the vibrant Helsinki brand.
- **Design and Implementation in sync** – Designers use a collection of Sketch libraries which are perfectly in sync with the implementation. 

## Packages

HDS is divided into three (3) separate packages:

- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hds-core?label=hds-core&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hds-core) – Helsinki City brand colors, typography and base styles as css-styles and variables
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hds-react?label=hds-react&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hds-react) – Provides HDS components implemented using React
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hds-design-tokens?label=hds-design-tokens&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hds-design-tokens) – Basis of the HDS which includes base colors, typography etc. as design tokens.

## Getting started

:wrench: **Are you a developer? If yes, start by checking out [HDS - For developers page](https://hds.hel.fi/developers).**<br />
:art: **Are you a designer? If yes, start by checking out [HDS - For designers page](https://hds.hel.fi/designers).**

Helsinki Design System uses [**Lerna**](https://lerna.js.org/) for running scripts across the repo as well as versioning and creating releases of the packages. [**Yarn workspaces**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) is used to manage dependencies. This allows the separate packages to reference each other via symlinks during local development.

### Using the packages in your project
See the package specific instructions on how to get started using the packages.

- [hds-design-tokens](./packages/design-tokens/README.md#getting-started)
- [hds-core](./packages/core/README.md#getting-started)
- [hds-react](./packages/react/README.md#getting-started)

### Setting up local development environment

0. Download and Install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) which is used to store images outside repository.
```bash
git lfs install
```
1. Clone the HDS repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system.git
```

2. Go to the root of the project and install dependencies with `yarn`.
```bash
cd helsinki-design-system
yarn
```

3. Build packages with `yarn build`. This builds all packages; core, react, design-tokens and site (documentation).
```bash
yarn build
```

4. Start the development server. You can start these individually for each platform with `yarn start:<platform>`. For example, to start the React Storybook development environment, run:
```bash
yarn start:react
```

### Commands

| Command                            | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| yarn                               | Installs dependencies and links local packages.                                    |
| yarn build                         | Builds all the packages.                                                           |
| yarn build:\<package>              | Builds a specific package (`tokens`, `core`, `react` or `site`).                   |
| yarn start:\<platform>             | Starts the development environment for a specific platform (`core` or `react`).    |
| lerna release                      | Publishes packages that have changed since the last release.                       |

To ensure code quality in the repo, every package will have their `pre-commit` and `pre-push` scripts run automatically before git commit and push (added with [**Husky**](https://github.com/typicode/husky)).
