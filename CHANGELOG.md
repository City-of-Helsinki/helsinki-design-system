- Updated the breakpoint and container width token values

| breakpoint token | old  | new  |

| container width token | old  | new  |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| xs                    | 304  | 288  |
| s                     | 560  | 544  |
| m                     | 752  | 720  |
| l                     | 968  | 944  |
| xl                    | 1200 | 1200 |

### Documentation

#### Added

- Documentation for all new (implemented) components; Navigation and Notifications
- New section: Data formats
- Currently includes initial guidelines for formatting date and time data

#### Changed

- Updated Breakpoints documentation with new breakpoint and container width values
- Updated Breakpoints documentation with new demonstration image

### React

#### Breaking Changes

- [Notification] component was rewritten. in ([#212](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/212))
  - DismissibleNotification was removed. Use the `dismissible` property instead.
  - The `labelText` prop was renamed to `label`
  - The supported types are now `info`, `error`, `alert` and `success`
  - Full list of supported props can be found [here](https://hds.hel.fi/storybook/react/?path=/docs/components-notification--default)

#### Added

- Navigation component. ([#197](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/197))
- Logo component. ([#197](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/197))

#### Changed

- Components are now bundled separately, making it possible to import only specific components instead of importing the whole package. in ([#229](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/229))
  - E.g. importing the `Button` component can now be done like this `import { Button } from 'hds-react/components/Button'`. Importing components directly could reduce the bundle size.
- Updated storybook. in ([#225](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/225))
  - Storybook should now load considerably faster.

#### Fixed

- [Dropdown] Reference equality comparison in multiselect mode. in ([#231](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/231))
  - Previously a selected option would be labeled as selected only if the selected items contained the exact same object. This could result in unexpected behavior for instance when a multiselect dropdown was used as a controlled component and its options list was not static.
- [Dropdown] Fixed focus issue when multiselect mode was enabled. in ([#222](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/222))
  - Fixed a bug where multi-select drop-downs retained their focus styles after pressing tab when the dropdown menu was open. Pressing tab now also correctly moves the focus to the next element in the tab order.
- [Checkbox] Fixed a bug where the label wasn't aligned correctly. in ([#226](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/226))
- [RadioButton] Fixed a bug where the label wasn't aligned correctly. in ([#226](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/226))

### React

#### Fixed

- [Button] Fixed wrong cursor being shown for buttons

## [0.12.0] - August 14, 2020

### Core

#### Breaking Changes

- Removed all global styles that were applied by the base.css file. in ([#199](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/199))
  - There were some global styles applied by the `base.css` file to heading and button elements that were removed

#### Added

- Status label component. in ([#204](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/204))
- The core .css files are now available as minified and non-minified versions. in ([#201](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/201))
- Required field indicator styles to the Core text-input and textarea components. in ([#198](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/198))

### Design kit

#### Added

- Status label component
- [Typography] New heading scale guidelines artboard
- [Typography] Text style variants listing tables for Body and Headings
- [Koros] Example of using Koros with images

#### Changed

- [Typography] Heading font sizes from H1–H6 to heading level agnostic T-shirt sizes (XXS–XL), to allow adapting heading level scale to layout
- [Typography] Body sizes naming from Small, Default, Medium, Large to S,M,L,XL for consistency with overall HDS token naming convention and to help prevent possible confusion between the conflicting size-medium and weight-medium
- [Typography] Style naming and numbering model to help navigate the library
  - **Body/Heading** element level numbering removed as irrelevant
  - **Size** numbering changed from 01 etc. to the pixel size of the style (at default 16px rem value)
  - **Weight** numbering changed from 01 etc. to the equivalent CSS weight value:
    - 400 Regular
    - 500 Medium
    - 700 Bold
  - **Alignment** variant numbering changed to marking that differentiates the Alignment selection from Colour variant selection and visualises the effect this selection has on the text right in the name:
    - Left
    - Center
    - (••• Right if needed in the future)
  - **Colour and style** variant numbering changed to predefined structure:
    - 01 Black
    - 02 White
    - 03 Disabled
    - 04 Placeholder
    - 05 Link
    - 06 Error
    - 07 Success
    - Brand colour variants are listed without numbers
  - [Grids and Breakpoints] Small tweaks were done to breakpoint and container width tokens to allow wider outside margins in edge cases between breakpoints. Other than breakpoint-xl, breakpoints are untouched while container widths between xs and l were made slightly smaller. To see exact values changed, please refer to the design tokens package notes
  - [Colours] Changed UI helper colours to improve accessibility. Following tokens have been changed:
    - `alert-dark` from #986700 to #d18200
    - `info` from #007293 to #006b9
    - `info-light` from #dcf1f5 to #e5eff8
    - `info-dark` from #005b76 to #004f94
- [Form Components] Increased Dropdown options from 3 to 5. Excess options can be easily hidden via using Sketch's Smart Layout features
- [Form Components] Moved Dropdown component focus border behind dropdown rectangle background to reflect implementation
- [Form Components] Symbolized Dropdown options. This means changing Dropdown option state (from resting to selected for example) is now done via overriding the symbol
- [Koros] Improved Koros/M/ symbols colour override. Colour can now be changed with just one selection instead of two separate selections
- Library updates for all libraries dependent on HDS Koros

#### Fixed

- [Typography] Unified text style line heights

#### Removed

- [Notifications] Temporarily removed Modals and Notifications library. New notifications will be added in the next update, and they will replace the old implementation

#### Known issues

- Some elements (e.g. buttons) do not resize correctly if the label is changed. This is due to a bug in Sketch related to Smart Layout. We are working with Sketch to try to resolve this issue

### Design tokens

#### Breaking changes

- Removed all component specific tokens. in ([#203](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/203))
