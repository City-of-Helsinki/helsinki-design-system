### React

#### Breaking Changes

  - The `labelText` prop was renamed to `label`
  - The supported types are now `info`, `error`, `alert` and `success`
  - Full list of supported props can be found [here](https://hds.hel.fi/storybook/react/?path=/docs/components-notification--default)

#### Added

- Navigation component. ([#197](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/197))
- Logo component. ([#197](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/197))

- [RadioButton] Fixed a bug where the label wasn't aligned correctly. in ([#226](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pull/226))

- [Typography] Body sizes naming from Small, Default, Medium, Large to S,M,L,XL for consistency with overall HDS token naming convention and to help prevent possible confusion between the conflicting size-medium and weight-medium
- [Typography] Style naming and numbering model to help navigate the library
  - **Body/Heading** element level numbering removed as irrelevant
  - **Size** numbering changed from 01 etc. to the pixel size of the style (at default 16px rem value)
  - **Weight** numbering changed from 01 etc. to the equivalent CSS weight value:
    - 400 Regular
    - 500 Medium
    - 700 Bold
  - **Alignment** variant numbering changed to marking that differentiates the Alignment selection from Colour variant selection and visualises the effect this selection has on the text right in the name:
    - Left
    - Center
    - (••• Right if needed in the future)
  - **Colour and style** variant numbering changed to predefined structure:
    - 01 Black
    - 02 White
    - 03 Disabled
    - 04 Placeholder
    - 05 Link
    - 06 Error
    - 07 Success
    - Brand colour variants are listed without numbers
  - [Grids and Breakpoints] Small tweaks were done to breakpoint and container width tokens to allow wider outside margins in edge cases between breakpoints. Other than breakpoint-xl, breakpoints are untouched while container widths between xs and l were made slightly smaller. To see exact values changed, please refer to the design tokens package notes
  - [Colours] Changed UI helper colours to improve accessibility. Following tokens have been changed:
    - `alert-dark` from #986700 to #d18200

- [Form Components] Increased Dropdown options from 3 to 5. Excess options can be easily hidden via using Sketch's Smart Layout features
- [Form Components] Moved Dropdown component focus border behind dropdown rectangle background to reflect implementation
- [Form Components] Symbolized Dropdown options. This means changing Dropdown option state (from resting to selected for example) is now done via overriding the symbol
- [Koros] Improved Koros/M/ symbols colour override. Colour can now be changed with just one selection instead of two separate selections
- Library updates for all libraries dependent on HDS Koros

#### Fixed

- [Typography] Unified text style line heights

#### Removed

- [Notifications] Temporarily removed Modals and Notifications library. New notifications will be added in the next update, and they will replace the old implementation

#### Known issues

- Some elements (e.g. buttons) do not resize correctly if the label is changed. This is due to a bug in Sketch related to Smart Layout. We are working with Sketch to try to resolve this issue
