# Development

## Development environment

> Helsinki Design System uses [**Lerna**](https://lerna.js.org/) for running scripts across the repo as well as versioning and creating releases of the packages. [**Yarn workspaces**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) is used to manage dependencies. This allows the separate packages to reference each other via symlinks during local development. [**Nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a node version manager used to specify the preferred node version across the project (optional but highly recommended, if not used, see the preferred version in .nvmrc file).

### Prerequisites

- [Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (For visual regression tests. Read more [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/development/packages/react/DEVELOPMENT.md#visual-regression-tests).)

### Setting up local development environment

1. Clone the HDS repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system.git
```

2. Go to the root of the project and install dependencies with `yarn`.

```bash
cd helsinki-design-system
yarn
```

3. Build packages with `yarn build`. This builds all packages; core, react, design-tokens, and site (documentation).

```bash
yarn build
```

4. Start the development server. You can start these individually for each platform with `yarn start:<platform>`. For example, to start the React Storybook development environment, run:

```bash
yarn start:react
```

| yarn                   | Installs dependencies and links local packages.                                 |
| yarn build             | Builds all the packages.                                                        |
| yarn build:\<package>  | Builds a specific package (`tokens`, `core`, `react`, `hds-js` or `site`).      |
| yarn start:\<platform> | Starts the development environment for a specific platform (`core` or `react`). |
| release                | Publishes packages that have changed since the last release.                    |

## Workflow

This project uses the [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). Happy branching!

1. Get the latest updates from the `development` branch. The `master` branch is only updated during the release process containing the latest released features while `development` branch has the latest features waiting for a new release.

```bash
git checkout development
git pull
```

2. Create a new branch for your changes.

```bash
git checkout -b hds-<Ticket number>-<Pull request title>
```

3. Push changes to the HDS remote repository.

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin hds-<Ticket number>-<Pull request title>
```

4. Make a Pull Request on the [HDS Github website](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/pulls).
