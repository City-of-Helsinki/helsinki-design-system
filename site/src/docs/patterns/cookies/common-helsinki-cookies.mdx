# Common Helsinki cookies

<StatusLabel type="alert">WIP</StatusLabel>

<LeadParagraph>
  Using common Helsinki cookie consent brings the benefit of sharing consents. This is useful both for the user and the
  service. The user only has to give their consent once and it becomes easier for the service to manage its cookies.

## Key principles of using common cookies - You can use common Helsinki cookies if your service is using the \*.hel.fi domain.

- When common cookies are available, use them instead of creating custom cookies. This way the user only has to give their
  consent once between multiple Helsinki services. - When a common cookie is used, it must be used **exactly** as described
  on this page. If you modify the cookie in any way, it is no longer a common cookie. - If your service is using custom cookies
  alongside common cookies, you still need to ask for consent for the custom cookies (if they are considered optional). - You
  can either use all or a part of the common cookies. - Note, that some of the services (e.g. Matomo) may require multiple
  common cookies for it to work.
