# Foundation overview

<LeadParagraph>Foundation is a guide for applying the visual guidelines to digital experiences.</LeadParagraph>

Helsinki Design System foundations describe how the <ExternalLink href="https://www.hel.fi/en/decision-making/information-on-helsinki/design-and-digitalisation/helsinki-brand-and-visual-identity/visual-identity-guidelines">Helsinki Visual Identity</ExternalLink> is applied to digital world. Foundation varies from detailed practical guides to broader principles that needs to be addressed when designing and developing a service.

**Design tokens** are the smallest building blocks of the design system. They are used across all Helsinki products to ensure matching visual identity.

**Visual assets** define the common set of graphical elements used in digital services.

**Guidelines** give answers and suggestions to common situations we come across in digital products. They describe the Helsinki way of solving these issues.
