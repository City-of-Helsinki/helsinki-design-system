## Usage

Spacing of elements can be used to create visual hierarchy for content and guide focus to certain elements. Too dense information can be hard to digest for a user, so make sure to leave enough space in the user interfaces.

### Principles
- Use small spacing to group elements together and larger spacing separate them. Elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced further apart.
- Use spacing to highlight important elements. Elements with more spacing around them tend to perceive higher importance than elements that have less space around them.
- Use spacing in a way that fits the function and content of the service. Ample spacing is more fitting for providing mood in branding and communication, denser spacing for performing information heavy tasks efficiently.

### Using spacing tokens
The spacing tokens are based on the HDS typographic scale. They are divided in two scales for different uses:

- **Spacing tokens** are used for component-level spacing, and allow a more detailed fine tuning.
- **Layout spacing tokens** are used for page layouts. They help keeping pages consistent and ensure that you are not making layouts too dense.

Token values can be multiplied and divided using even numbers.
