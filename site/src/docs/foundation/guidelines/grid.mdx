# Grid

<LeadParagraph>Helsinki Design System follows a 12 column grid system that scales across five defined breakpoints. Using a
  pre-defined grid system helps to keep visual consistency and rhythm across your designs and implementations.</LeadParagraph>

<Notification label="Note about HDS Grid values!" className="siteNotification">
  HDS does not currently include an implementation of the grid. Grid is provided as specified breakpoints and other
  values which can be easily applied to most commonly used grid systems.
</Notification>

## Principles

- HDS uses a standard 12 column grid whose maximum width is 1200 pixels. Container width and the number of columns change each breakpoint.
  - The <InternalLink href="/components/header">Header component</InternalLink> is an exception with maximum width of 1440 pixels so it should not be placed inside the grid container.
- Larger screen sizes use 24-pixel gutters while on mobile screen widths they shrink to 16 pixels and eventually to 12 pixels in the smallest breakpoint.
- Even though HDS does not include grid implementation, it recommends and suggests methods how to handle changing amount of columns and column stacking. See [Layout columns](#layout-columns) for more information.
  - HDS also offers a Container component that helps to follow breakpoints and container widths. For more info refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/breakpoints">Breakpoints documentation.</InternalLink>

## Grid behaviour

The following table presents how the HDS grid behaves and changes in different breakpoints. Maximum container width, the number of columns, and gutter size alter between breakpoints.

| Breakpoint token                                            | Container-width token  | Number of columns | Margin (gutter) in px |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------: | --------------------: |
| `--breakpoint-xs`                                           | `--container-width-xs` |                 4 |                  16px |
| `--breakpoint-s`                                            | `--container-width-s`  |                 4 |                  16px |
| `--breakpoint-m`                                            | `--container-width-m`  |                 8 |                  24px |
| `--breakpoint-l`                                            | `--container-width-l`  |                12 |                  24px |
| `--breakpoint-xl`                                           | `--container-width-xl` |                12 |                  24px |

## Layout columns

### Dividing columns

12 column grid can be divided into multiple smaller columns. Prefer simple and even column combinations to maintain visual consistency across all screen sizes.

  style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', minWidth: 600, maxWidth: 915, margin: '0 auto' }}
  viewable
/>

### Column stacking

When the breakpoint is reached, columns will stack starting from the left. The developer or designer can also choose to alter column sizes if it helps to maintain a clearer and more consistent view.
