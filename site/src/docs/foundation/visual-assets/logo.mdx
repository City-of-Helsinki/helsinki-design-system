# Logo

<LeadParagraph>
  The City of Helsinki logo is used in digital services for identifying the site as an official City of Helsinki service.
</LeadParagraph>

The City of Helsinki logo consists of the text *Helsinki* framed by the shape derived from the city crest. The logo must be used in accordance with the <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/logo">Visual Identity Guidelines - Logo</ExternalLink>. See the <InternalLink href="/components/logo">Logo component documentation</InternalLink> for instructions on using Logo in implementation.

**Please do not attempt to recreate the logo!** Always use the appropriate original file. The City of Helsinki logo is a registered trademark.

## Principles
Official City of Helsinki services must always show the City of Helsinki logo, which is placed:
- at the top left corner of the page, in the header component
- at the bottom of the page, in the footer component

In other parts of the page, the logo should be used sparingly. For web page or tab icons use the <InternalLink href="/foundation/visual-assets/favicon">favicon</InternalLink> instead.

## Usage

### Sizes
The City of Helsinki logo and the accompanying language versions come in two sizes, `Medium` and `Small`.
