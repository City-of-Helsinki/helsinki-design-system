# Favicon

<LeadParagraph>
  The City of Helsinki favicon is used in digital services to identify the site window, tab or web app.
</LeadParagraph>

The favicon consists of the letter H framed by the shape derived from the city crest. The favicon should only be used for the site window, tab or web app. For general use the <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/logo">Logo</ExternalLink> should be used instead.

**Do not attempt to recreate the favicon!**
Always use the original files found in the Favicon kit included in HDS releases.

**Note:** The City of Helsinki logo is a registered trademark.

## Principles
Official City of Helsinki services must always show the City of Helsinki favicon:
- Sitewide, in the browser website title
- Web app's app icon
- Use the same favicon variant consistently, the default is the light theme and for dark themes the dark theme

## Usage

### Contrast
The Helsinki framed favicon is primarily used in with a transparent background. On modern browsers the icon changes color automatically according to web browser theme.
- Check that the colour contrast of the favicon and its background is compliant with <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">AA Level contrast ratios</ExternalLink>.
- For more information, see the <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/colours/">Visual Identity Guidelines - Colours</ExternalLink>.

## Variants

There are two variations of the favicon with specific purposes.

- **Light favicon package** Black favicon assets are used on light backgrounds.
- **Dark favicon package** White favicon assets are used on dark backgrounds.
