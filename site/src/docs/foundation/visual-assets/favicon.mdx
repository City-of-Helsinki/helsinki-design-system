# Favicon

<LeadParagraph>
  The City of Helsinki favicon is used in digital services to identify the site window or tab.
</LeadParagraph>

The favicon consists of the text *Helsinki* framed by the shape derived from the city crest. The favicon must be used in accordance with the <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/">Visual Identity Guidelines</ExternalLink>.

**Do not attempt to recreate the favicon!** 
Always use the appropriate original file. 

**Note:** The City of Helsinki logo is a registered trademark.

## Principles 
Official City of Helsinki services must always show the City of Helsinki favicon: 
- Sitewide, in the browser website title
- Use the same favicon variant consistently

## Usage

### Contrast
The Helsinki framed favicon is primarily used in black, white, or with a transparent background depending on the circumstance.
- Check that the colour contrast of the favicon and its background is compliant with <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">AA Level contrast ratios</ExternalLink>.
- For more information, see the <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/colours/">Visual Identity Guidelines - Colours</ExternalLink>.
