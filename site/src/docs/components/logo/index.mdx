import TabsLayout from './tabs.mdx';

export default ({ children, pageContext }) => <TabsLayout pageContext={pageContext}>{children}</TabsLayout>;

## Usage

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo src={logoFi} size="medium" alt="logo"/>
</PlaygroundPreview>

The logo is used to identify the site or application.
See the <InternalLink size="M" href="/foundation/visual-assets/logo">logo visual asset documentation</InternalLink> for more information about principles of using the City of Helsinki logo.

### Principles

- Logo should be used in HDS Navigation and HDS Footer (not yet released) components. **Use the Logo component sparingly in other parts of the service.**
- **You should include the service name next to the logo.** This helps the user more easily identify which city service they are currently using.
- The Logo component does not include translations itself but localization can be achieved by changing the logo src accordingly.
- The Logo component should act as a link to the main page of the service.

### Variations

#### Default

The Helsinki logo component included is offered in three (3) languages.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo src={logoFi} size="medium" style={{marginRight: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}}/>
  <Logo src={logoSv} size="medium" style={{marginRight: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}} />
  <Logo src={logoRu} size="medium" />
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### Sizes

The component includes three (3) size variants to fit the context. If omitted, the logo uses all available space.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <Logo src={logoFi} size="small" style={{marginRight: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}} />
  <Logo src={logoFi} size="medium" style={{marginRight: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}} />
  <Logo src={logoFi} size="large" />
</PlaygroundPreview>
