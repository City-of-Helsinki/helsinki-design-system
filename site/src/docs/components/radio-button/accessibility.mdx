## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- When multiple Radio buttons are related to each other, group them together using <InternalLink href="/components/selection-group">HDS Selection group</InternalLink>. Selection group also includes a title for the group.
