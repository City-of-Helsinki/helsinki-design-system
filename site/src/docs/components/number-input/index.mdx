## Usage

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <NumberInput
    id="example"
    helperText="Assistive text"
    label="Total compensation"
    unit="€"
    defaultValue={1000}
    style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>

### Principles

- **A label should always be provided with a number input.**
  - Make sure that the label is clear and concise. The user should immediately understand what number they are supposed to input.
- HDS Number input also supports displaying an unit for the number. Displaying the unit is not mandatory. Only use it when you think it will help the user.
  - Display the unit for <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI units</ExternalLink> (such as meters) and currencies.
  - The unit does not need to be displayed when it is self-evident for the user, such as in "Number of people"
- It is recommended to give the number input a default value. Placeholders should be avoided in number inputs.
- HDS Number input supports visual steppers that can be set to increase and decrease the number value by a set amount.
  - Steppers can be used when changes to the value are small or when they are intuitive to the user (e.g. from 0 to 100 with steps of 10).
  - You should not use steppers when large value changes are expected.

### Variations

#### Default

Default HDS Number input comes without stepper. The number is always inputted manually. Using this over a text input is still helpful since it has a `type=number` to aid screen readers and mobile keyboards.

When applicable, a unit can be set for the input by using the `unit` prop.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <NumberInput
    id="default"
    helperText="Assistive text"
    label="Total compensation"
    unit="€"
    defaultValue={1000}
    style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### With steppers

Steppers can be enabled via providing a `step` property. Use this variant when value changes are small and you can determine logical amounts for an increase and a decrease step.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <NumberInput
    id="stepper"
    helperText="Assistive text"
    label="Number of attendees"
    minusStepButtonAriaLabel="Decrease by one"
    plusStepButtonAriaLabel="Increase by one"
    step={1}
    defaultValue={5}
    style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>

#### With min and max values

Steppers can be enabled by providing a `step` property. Use this variant when value changes are small and you can determine logical amounts for an increase and a decrease step.

If your input has special requirements, it is a good practice to describe them in the assistive text.

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <NumberInput
    id="stepper-minmax"
    helperText="At least 3 attendees are required"
    label="Number of attendees"
    min={3}
    max={99}
    minusStepButtonAriaLabel="Decrease by one"
    plusStepButtonAriaLabel="Increase by one"
    step={1}
    defaultValue={3}
    style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }}
  />
</PlaygroundPreview>
