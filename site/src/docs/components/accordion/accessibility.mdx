## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Use HDS provided accordion elements when creating custom accordions. These elements pass accessibility testing.
- When creating custom accordions, make sure that the expanded accordion area directly follows the accordion button in the DOM tree.
    - If you must place the accordion area somewhere else, use `aria-owns` attribute to indicate the relationship. However, be aware that this attribute does not necessarily work with all screen readers.
- Make sure that the keyboard user can navigate out of the accordion area without closing the accordion. See <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#no-keyboard-trap">WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap guideline</ExternalLink> for more information.
