## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- HDS Footer is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing the footer link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element.
