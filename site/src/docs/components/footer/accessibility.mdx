## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- HDS Footer is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing the footer link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element.
- Footer landmark is provided automatically by the wrapping `<footer>` element. In case you want more landmarks, all the Footer sub components support `role` prop which should be used together with a descriptive `aria-label` prop. Just remember that landmarks should be used sparingly in order to avoid "noise" for screen readers and making the overall page layout difficult to understand.
