## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- Each page number must have an `aria-label` to describe it. For example, `aria-label="Page 3"`.
- The active page number must have an `aria-current="page"` attribute.
- The truncation element ("..." or ellipsis) does not need to have an `aria-label`.
- Pay attention to where to move focus after a user changes a page. In some cases, you might want to move the focus to the
  beginning of the search results. But in many cases, this is not advised.
- Provide a screen reader notification (`aria-live` and `aria-atomic`) when a user changes a page. Especially this is
  important when the user changes the page by using the component's previous or next buttons. If you use the HDS React
  component of the pagination, this feature is automatically provided.
