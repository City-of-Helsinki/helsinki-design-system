## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- For interactable Tags you must set a descriptive `aria-label` for assistive technologies so the user understands what happens if the Tag is clicked. For example `aria-label="Move to category: <category name>"`.
- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- If you are customising tag colours, make sure they are easily distinguishable from <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour#ui-colours">HDS UI Colours.</InternalLink> These colours are reserved to present UI state and status information in applications using HDS.
- Remember that colour should never be the only way of conveying information. Make sure the meaning of the status label is clearly described by the label text. Refer to <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html">WCAG 2.1 Use of Color guideline</ExternalLink> for more information.

### Which role attribute should be used with Tags?

- HDS Tags can be clickable. In this case, it needs either a `role=“link”` or `role=“button”` as an attribute. The role value should be decided as follows:
  - If the user's focus is moved to another location or another page is opened, the role should be `link`. Example: The user clicks a Tag labelled as "News". The tag takes the user to a new page that lists all items tagged as "News".
  - If, however, the tag will result in the page's content being dynamically changed (i.e. Tag triggers an action), use `role=“button”`. Example: Clicking the tag will cause a search below to be filtered.
