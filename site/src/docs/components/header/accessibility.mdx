## Accessibility

### Pay attention to

- HDS Navigation is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to <InternalLink href="/foundation/design-tokens/colour">colour guidelines</InternalLink> to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing a menu link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** First, make sure top-level menu labels are clear, and submenu items contextually fit under it. Next, make sure the menu option order is logical and reasonable. Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element and thus placing a commonly used menu option last is not optimal.
- Landmarks are provided by the wrapping `<header>` element, `<nav>` element in the Header.NavigationMenu component and with `role="search"` attribute on the Header.HeaderSearch component. In case you want more landmarks, the Header.UniversalBar, Header.ActionBar and Header.HeaderSearch components support `role` prop which should be used together with a descriptive `aria-label` prop. Just remember that landmarks should be used sparingly in order to avoid "noise" for screen readers and making the overall page layout difficult to understand.
- Header.NavigationMenu's dropdowns open only by clicking them. They don't open from hovering with the mouse as it can be difficult to navigate for people with motor and seeing challenges.
- Only use the elements you need. Avoid clutter.
