## API

### Common properties

These properties are used by the standalone class, the <InternalLink href="#react-context">Cookie consent context</InternalLink>, and the <InternalLink href="#usecookieconsent-hook">useCookieConsent hook</InternalLink>.

Common texts, groups and cookie data can be found in <ExternalLink openInExternalDomainAriaLabel="Opens in a new domain" openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/cookieConsentCore/example/minimal_sitesettings.json">minimal sitesettings example</ExternalLink>. The file contains all user interface strings, language options, descriptions for common cookie groups, and details about common Helsinki cookies.
There is also an example <ExternalLink openInExternalDomainAriaLabel="Opens in a new domain" openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/cookieConsentCore/example/common_sitesettings.json">hel.fi sitesettings example</ExternalLink> with all the translations. The file contains all user interface strings, language options, descriptions for common cookie groups, and details about common Helsinki cookies. You can also override parts of it and add your project-specific groups and cookies. Remember to replace the `INSERT_YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE.hel.fi` -strings in the settings file with the domain name of your service.

| [Table 8: Properties of the CookieConsentCore instance ] |

### Saving consents

Consents that the user has given are saved to a `city-of-helsinki-cookie-consents` cookie. A version number indicating which version of the component is in use, is stored to a `city-of-helsinki-cookie-consents-version` cookie. The version number has no relation to the stored consents.

Cookies are always strings and consents are stored as a JSON-formatted string such as `{"cookie-id":"true","another-cookie-id":"false"}`.

The ID of the cookie is stored as `cookie.id`. `True` means the user has given consent for that cookie. All required cookies are always stored `true`, but other sites may list a common cookie optional, so the stored consent is not `true` by default.

### Callbacks

The React context and hooks have the `onChange` callback. The cookie consent class dispatches <InternalLink href="#events">events</InternalLink> that can be listened also without React.

### Events

The cookie consent class dispatches three kinds of events:

- `hds-cookie-consent-ready` is dispatched when the class instance is ready and has loaded settings and consents.
- `hds-cookie-consent-unapproved-item-found` is dispatched when the monitoring system finds an unapproved stored item.
- `hds-cookie-consent-changed` is dispatched if the `options.submitEvent` is set to `true` and users change their consents. If not set, the Browser page is reloaded instead.

Note: the React context, hooks, and components always set `submitEvent` to `true`.

Events are dispatched with `window.dispatchEvent` and can be listened with `window.addEventListener`. Events are dispatched in React and vanilla-js versions.

| [Table 12: Properties of the CookieConsentChangeEvent] |

### CSS variables

The current height of the banner is set to a CSS variable in the `html` element.

```jsx
<html style="--hds-cookie-consent-height: 123px;">
```

The variable is useful when adjusting the position of elements that could overlay the cookie consent banner. It's removed when the banner is closed.

### Using without React

The `hds-js` and <InternalLink href="/components/cookie-consent/code/#standalone-version">standalone</InternalLink> versions work in any javascript environment.

```jsx
import { CookieConsentCore } from 'hds-js';

const siteSettings = 'url to the settings json or settings as an object';
const options = {
  // options
};
const instance = await CookieConsentCore.create(siteSettings, options);
// the banner opens automatically when needed and options.settingsPageId is not set
```

Note that the `CookieConsentCore.create` is an asynchronous function.

It is recommended to set `options.submitEvents` to `true` when using the <InternalLink href="/components/cookie-consent/#rendered-on-a-page">page</InternalLink> version. Otherwise the whole page is reloaded after save and the user will not see a notification about successful save and may not notify changes.

The whole page is also reloaded when using the <InternalLink href="/components/cookie-consent/#banner">banner</InternalLink> without `options.submitEvents`, but the banner is closed when the consents are stored and before the page reloads.

When events are used, the changes done by the user should be handled with <InternalLink href="#events">event listeners.</InternalLink>

### React context

The recommended way to use cookie consents in React is with the `CookieConsentContext`. The context compares stored consents to the site settings and does not render its children until consents are parsed. This is an asyncronous operation and ensures consents are always available to all child components.

```jsx
import { CookieConsentContextProvider, CookieConsentChangeEvent } from 'hds-react';
const onChange = (e: CookieConsentChangeEvent) => {
  // listen to changes here
};
const options = {
  // set options here
};
const siteSettings = {
  // set site settings here
};
<CookieConsentContextProvider
  onChange={onChange}
  options={options}
  siteSettings={siteSettings}
></CookieConsentContextProvider>;
```

Internally, the context uses the <InternalLink href="#usecookieconsent-hook">useCookieConsents hook</InternalLink> and returns the same object the hook returns.

#### Hooks requiring the React context

#### useCookieConsentEvents hook

The cookie consent class dispatches window level events. These can be listened to with `window.addEventListener`. The `useCookieConsentEvents` hook does this and also handles the removal of the event listeners when the component unmounts. The hook also returns a disposer function to manually remove the event listeners.

| [Table 14: Properties of the useCookieConsentEvents] |

#### useCookieConsent hook

This hook creates the class instance, listens to events, and renders the parent component when consents or `isReady` are changed. The `CookieConsentContext` uses this hook, so there is no need to use this hook and the context at the same time. Both can be used, but they share the same class instance.
Other context related hooks and components use this hook and its returned functions automatically. Usually there is no need to use this hook manually.

```jsx
import { useCookieConsent, CookieConsentChangeEvent } from 'hds-react';

const MyComponent = ()=>{

  const onChange = (e:CookieConsentChangeEvent) => {
    // listen to changes here
  };
  const options = {
    // set options here
  };
  const siteSettings = {
    // set site settings here
  };
  const settingsPageId = 'site-settings;

  const {isReady } = useCookieConsent({onChange, options, siteSettings, settingsPageId})

  if(!isReady){
    return null;
  }

  return (<p>Ready</p>)
}
```

The context does not render its children if the returned `isReady` property is not true. It is true when settings have been loaded, parsed and compared to the stored consents of the user. This is the safest way to ensure all consents are loaded before components rely on the data.

### React components

#### CookieBanner

Renders the banner, but only if the user has not given all necessary consents. Add this component to all pages except where the `CookieSettingsPage` is used. This component requires the <InternalLink href="#react-context">Cookie Consent context</InternalLink>.

#### CookieSettingsPage

Renders only the contents of the cookie banner, so the same content can be used in the banner and also on a settings page. Do not use the `CookieBanner` on the same page or the user might see two places to edit consents. This component requires the <InternalLink href="#react-context">Cookie Consent context</InternalLink>.
