## API

### Component properties

Common texts, groups and cookie data can be found in <Link href="">HDS-provided content file</Link>. The file contains all user interface strings, language options, descriptions for common cookie groups, and details about common Helsinki cookies. By default, this content file is used. You can also override parts of it and add your project-specific groups and cookies. 

#### ContentSource
The `contentSource` property lists all content, language options, and callbacks for the component. The given source is merged with the default `content.json` to create a content-object.

##### ContentSource examples
TODO

#### CookieDomain 
Rarely used. Cookie consents are stored to a cookie whose domain is automatically set to accept subdomains: *.hel.fi or *.hel.ninja or *.domain.com. Some sites are included in the public suffix list and cookies for those sites cannot accept subdomain cookies. Github.io is one of those sites and HDS examples do not work there unless the cookie domain can be overridden. Therefore `cookieDomain` was added.

### Saving consents

Consents that the user has given are saved to a `city-of-helsinki-cookie-consents` cookie.

Cookies are always strings and consents are stored as a JSON-formatted string such as `{"cookie-id":"true","another-cookie-id":"false"}`.

The ID of the cookie is stored to `cookie.id`. `True` means the user has given consent for that cookie.  All required cookies are always stored `true` But other sites may list a common cookie optional, so the stored consent is not `true` by default.
