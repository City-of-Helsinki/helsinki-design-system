## API

### Component properties

Common texts, groups and cookie data can be found in <ExternalLink openInExternalDomainAriaLabel="Opens in a new domain" openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/cookieConsent/content.json">HDS-provided content file</ExternalLink>. The file contains all user interface strings, language options, descriptions for common cookie groups, and details about common Helsinki cookies. By default, this content file is used. You can also override parts of it and add your project-specific groups and cookies.

#### ContentSource

The `contentSource` property lists all content, language options, and callbacks for the component. The given source is merged with the default `content.json` to create a content-object.

##### ContentSource examples
You can find examples of ContentSource property contents in <Link openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="/storybook/react/?path=/story/components-cookieconsent--english-modal-version">the HDS CookieConsent Storybook examples</Link>.

#### CookieDomain

The cookie domain is automatically detected from the site the component is on. By default, the component sets the cookie domain to be the root domain with `*.` This way the cookie consents can be read from all subdomains. For example `*.hel.fi`.

If your site domain is included in the [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/) or you do not wish to expose your cookies to subdomains, or you want to set the domain manually for some reason, then use the `cookieDomain` property.

Cookies for domains on the public suffix list cannot accept subdomain cookies. E.g. `github.io`.

### Saving consents

Consents that the user has given are saved to a `city-of-helsinki-cookie-consents` cookie.

Cookies are always strings and consents are stored as a JSON-formatted string such as `{"cookie-id":"true","another-cookie-id":"false"}`.

The ID of the cookie is stored as `cookie.id`. `True` means the user has given consent for that cookie. All required cookies are always stored `true`, but other sites may list a common cookie optional, so the stored consent is not `true` by default.
