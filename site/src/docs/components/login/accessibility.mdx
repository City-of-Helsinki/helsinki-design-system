export default ({ children, pageContext }) => <TabsLayout pageContext={pageContext}>{children}</TabsLayout>;

## Accessibility

Currently, the OIDC provider, Helsinki Profile, does not inform users that they are being redirected and will be redirected back.

The <InternalLink href="/components/login/usage/#loginbutton">LoginButton</InternalLink> component shows only errors and does not inform about the redirection because Helsinki Profile should do it.
