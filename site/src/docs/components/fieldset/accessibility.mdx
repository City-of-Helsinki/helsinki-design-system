## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- Note that the heading is programmatically attached to each form element it contains. When assistive technologies focus a form element inside a Fieldset, they will announce the Fieldset heading in addition to the focused element information.
- Fieldset heading does not replace form element labels. Each form element still must have their own label. For more information, refer to <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html">WCAG 3.3.2 Labels and Instructions guideline</ExternalLink>.
