## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- HDS Navigation is designed to support many different brand colours. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/foundation/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing a menu link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** First, make sure top-level menu labels are clear, and submenu items contextually fit under it. Next, make sure the menu option order is logical and reasonable. Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element and thus placing a commonly used menu option last is not optimal.
- If there are multiple navigational components on the page, they should have individual aria-labels. This helps screen reader users to distinguish them from each other. The NavigationRow component has an ariaLabel property for that purpose.
