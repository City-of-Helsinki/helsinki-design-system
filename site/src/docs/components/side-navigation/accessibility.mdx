## Accessibility

### Pay attention to
- **When designing a menu link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** First, make sure top-level menu labels are clear, and submenu items contextually fit under the top-level. Next, make sure the menu option order is logical and reasonable. Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element and thus placing a commonly used menu option last is not optimal.
- If you are using both the main (top) and the side navigation, it is a good practice to include an anchor link to the side navigation at the beginning of the main (top) navigation. This way assistive technologies can easily access the side navigation after a page load.
- If there are multiple navigational components on the page, they should have individual aria-labels. This helps screen reader users to distinguish them from each other. The SideNavigation component has an `aria-label` property for that purpose.
