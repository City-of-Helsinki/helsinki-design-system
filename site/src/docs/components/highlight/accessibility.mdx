## Accessibility
- Both the Quote and Highlight elements are non-interactable and therefore do not have any special keyboard functionality.

### Pay attention to
- Both the Quote and Highlight components have three size variants; Large (l), Medium (m) and Small (s)
- Sizing variants differ in typography size and inner spacing.
- Both the Higlight and Quote adds vertical margin around the actual content
