## Principles
TODO

## Accessibility
- Always make sure that cookie consent is either the first item in the page tab order or a link is placed leading to it.
- Always provide `accessibleLabel` property for assistive technology to replace the visible “OK” text in the action button.
- When providing a “read more” link, it’s required to give some additional information to users of assistive technologies by using visually hidden components.
- Cookie Consent uses `tabindex="0"` to make it possible to access it using the tab key or programmatically move focus to it.
