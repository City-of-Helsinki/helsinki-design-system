# Getting started as a Designer

<LeadParagraph>
    The HDS design kit contains all the resources you need to get started designing beautiful and accessible user experiences that follow the City of Helsinki brand.
</LeadParagraph>

The HDS design libraries are the single point of reference for your design. When you connect your design files with the design system libraries, you can have the components synced whenever the design system is updated.

## Principles

Always keep these core principles in mind when making design decisions:
- **Modular and flexible:** All components are designed to work as reusable, customisable building blocks to help people work smarter, better, and faster.
- **Consistent:** All components are designed to fit together seamlessly to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience.
- **Accessibility baked-in:** Accessibility is part of the process from start to end. It is designed to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.

## Getting started
1. Explore the City of Helsinki <ExternalLink href="https://brand.hel.fi/">Visual Identity Guidelines</ExternalLink> to learn the design principles of the brand.
2. Take a look at the <InternalLink href="/components">Components documentation</InternalLink> to see what is available and how you can incorporate those into your designs.
3. The design assets are available either via direct design kit download or via the City of Helsinki Abstract. To use HDS libraries, you will need to install Sketch. See more on downloading and setting up the libraries below.
4. If you have an idea for improvements or a component that could be a useful addition to the Design System, see the <InternalLink href="/getting-started/contributing/how-to-contribute">Contributing</InternalLink> page for more information.

## Setting up

### Install the tools
The HDS design workflow is based on **Sketch** and **Abstract** (if you have access to Helsinki organisation):
- <ExternalLink href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</ExternalLink> is a <strong>vector graphics editor</strong> and is widely adopted by designers to create user interface designs for web and mobile services.
- <ExternalLink href="https://www.abstract.com/">Abstract</ExternalLink> is a <strong>design collaboration and version and management tool</strong> that enables designers to share Sketch files and libraries easily. By leveraging and extending the technology of Git, Abstract provides design teams with a lightweight workflow and stable tools so designers can work together with confidence.


If you are a newcomer to Sketch or Abstract, they both offer some great tutorials and help 

- <ExternalLink href="https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/">Sketch help docs</ExternalLink>
- <ExternalLink href="https://www.abstract.com/help/">Abstract help docs</ExternalLink>

**You do not necessarily need Abstract to use HDS design libraries.** Abstract is a convenient way to access and update Sketch libraries, but we also offer a downloadable HDS design kit. <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases/latest/download/hds-design-kit.zip">Download the latest HDS Design kit from the HDS GitHub repository</ExternalLink>. Please note that if you use the design kit outside of Abstract, you need to manually download the kit again to gain access to the newest updates.


### Install fonts
Make sure that you have the <ExternalLink href="https://camelot-typefaces.com/helsinki-grotesk">Helsinki Grotesk font</ExternalLink> installed.

Helsinki Grotesk font can be purchased from <ExternalLink href="https://camelot-typefaces.com/helsinki-grotesk">Camelot Typefaces website</ExternalLink>

### Set up your Abstract project
To set up a project in Abstract, you will need to:

1. Create a new Abstract project
2. Add at least one design (Sketch) file to the project
3. Link HDS libraries to your project
4. Create a branch and start making design changes

**If you are new to Abstract**, please read <InternalLink href="/getting-started/tutorials/abstract-tutorial">HDS Getting started with Abstract tutorial</InternalLink> for more information on how to set up and use Abstract.

## Get familiar with HDS
Before you start designing, it is a good idea to get familiar with the HDS offering.

For designers, a good place to start is to browse through design collections in the HDS Abstract project.

### Customising component symbols
The component symbols use _smart layout_ for easy resizing. You can also configure the content and styling of symbol parts from the _Overrides_ section of symbol properties.

_When changing the colour or other styles of component symbols, be sure your custom design adheres to the design guidelines._ Styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

### Styling text elements
Linking the HDS Typography library to your project adds the possibility to give HDS text styles to your text elements. You can add text styles to your layout in two ways:

1. You can add a new text element with appropriate text style from the Insert menu: Select the HDS Typography from the Text styles section, choose the desired text style, and click anywhere on your artboard. This creates a new text element with the chosen style.

2. You can give text styles to existing text elements by selecting the text element and changing its style from the _Appearance_ sidebar.
