# Contributing to the development

<LeadParagraph>
    Ready made components are what make HDS tick. You can contribute to HDS React and Core libraries by proposing new implementations and bugfixes to existing components.
</LeadParagraph>

When contributing for implementation, create a <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</ExternalLink> to the <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system">HDS GitHub repository</ExternalLink>.

### Guidelines for implementation
- HDS follows dev.hel.fi frontend coding standards: <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://dev.hel.fi/coding-standards#frontend-code-standards">Frontend coding standards</ExternalLink>

#### General guides
- Do not merge the pull request after it is accepted. The HDS team will merge it. Merging the PR has a side-effect that will update the documentation site.
- Remember to apply <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/packages/design-tokens/tokens">HDS Design tokens package</ExternalLink> when creating a component. Instead of specifying pixel values, colours, fonts, or breakpoints by yourself, apply those from design tokens instead
- Take a look at <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://dev.hel.fi/">Develop with Helsinki site</ExternalLink> for practical details for developing open source code for the City of Helsinki.

#### HDS Technologies

- HDS React and HDS Core both apply the <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook library</ExternalLink>
- HDS React is built with Typescript and SASS
- HDS Core is built with pure JS and CSS
- HDS applies yarn as its dependency manager
- HDS applies git for version control

#### Creating a new component

- Apply the Scaffolding yarn script when creating a new component: <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/package.json#L17">Scaffolding</ExternalLink>
- For simple components, create both versions, HDS Core and HDS React.
  Create common styles to HDS core that you can then import to HDS React like in <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/textInput/TextInput.module.css">this example</ExternalLink>.
  HDS React has HDS Core as its dependency.

- Add ready components to <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/rollup.config.js">rollup.config.js</ExternalLink>

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for each component. Test rendering, accessibility, and possible functionality of the component. HDS applies <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</ExternalLink> for unit testing. Example of unit tests can be found here: <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/numberInput/NumberInput.test.tsx">Number input unit tests</ExternalLink>
- HDS applies <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://loki.js.org/">Loki</ExternalLink> for visual regression testing. Loki is integrated with Storybook. Hence it's important to add a story for each different UI state of the component
- It is a good idea to test the component independently in a fresh <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/hds-cra">Create React App</ExternalLink>
