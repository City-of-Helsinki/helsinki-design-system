# Migrate to version 4.0.0

This guide helps you to start using HDS version 4.0.0.

## Breaking changes

This major release contains some breaking changes. Pay attention to these when you update your project to use the new version.

### Tag component rewritten

#### React

The Tag component has been rewritten and `iconStart` and `iconEnd` -properties have now been added.
Prop `size` is now a Typescript enum with proper values (`TagSize.Small` and `TagSize.Large`).
Prop `role`has been removed and the component itself handles it role.
`deleteButtonAriaLabel`, `deleteButtonProps`, `labelProps` and `srOnlyLabel` have also been removed.
There's also no separate delete-button inside the Tag in the Deletable variant.

#### Core

In Core-side also using hds-icons is now possible with classes without additional `<span>`'s.

#### Both

Theming has also been modified a bit with changed css-variable names. New design also makes slight changes to the stylings.

### Button component rewritten

#### React

The Button component has been rewritten and `iconLeft` and `iconRight` -properties have now been renamed as `iconStart` and `iconEnd` to support future implementation of RTL (right-to-left) languages.
`Size`, `theme` and `variant` are all now Typescript enums with proper values (used to be Types and included "default" as value).
Properties `isLoading` and `loadingText` have been removed and implementing a loading button is done by setting the Button's variant as `clear` (`ButtonVariant.Clear`), giving the Button a `<LoadingSpinner small />` as it's `iconStart` and changing the label to something that informs the user about the loading status. Also to consider is whether to add `disabled` prop or not.

#### Core

In Core-side also using hds-icons is now possible with classes without additional `<span>`'s.

Theming has also been added through css-variables. New design also makes slight changes to the stylings.

### Link component changes

#### React

Link has changed props, `iconLeft` has been renamed to `iconStart`.
Separate `ariaLabel` has been removed, replaced by using native `aria-label` -property.
Size prop is now a Typescript-enum with values `LinkSize.Small`, `LinkSize.Medium` and `LinkSize.Large`, which correspond to string values `small`, `medium` and `large`.

### Notification and ErrorSummary

#### React

Both Notification and ErrorSummary have their `size` prop changed to enum.
Notification size is now `NotificationSize.Small`, `NotificationSize.Medium` or `NotificationSize.Large`
while ErrorSummary has `ErrorSummarySize.Medium` and `ErrorSummarySize.Large` values. In both the medium value is the default.

### Hero component arrow icon takes space and may require a background color to be set

#### React and core

The arrow icon's container had `height:0`, but now it takes space and therefore a background color may be needed. By default the Hero's own `--background-color` is shown but it can be overridden with `--bottom-background-color`. In some cases `--bottom-background-color: var(--bottom-koros-color)` is sufficient.

In HDS 3.x.x the arrow also overlapped with the element below. That is not the case any more and has to be achived now by adding negative `margin-top` to the element below.

### Visual changes
#### Headings
There are updates to lineheights to improve readability especially on Headings. Please check that the layout does not break.

#### Black-60 changed to more accesible shade
Design token black-60 is changed from #666666 to #595959 to improve contrast with other colours. With only bus-dark and black-90 the contrast gets worse, all other colours the contrast improves. If needed, verify the used colours.

## Design kit

This guide will help you understand how to transition an existing project from using an older version of HDS Figma Design Kit to using the latest 4.0.0 version.

### What’s changing?
This HDS Design Kit update follows the changes deployed in the code for the 4.0.0 release of HDS. The major differences include significant changes to the CookieConsent, Dropdown and Tag components. The new Select and Multiselect components replace the old Dropdown.

The line heights of headings have been updated in the HDS Design Kit to improve readability, especially with larger titles. We have improved color black-60 for better contrast by changing it from #666666 to #595959.

The HDS Design Kit in Figma has undergone a major restructuring: now, each component is placed on its own page. This new organisation makes it much easier to find components without having to guess which group they belong to. Each component will also have better documentation, which may include main component, subcomponents, specifications, variant examples, and usage & prototype examples, depending on the need and documentation status. We hope these changes will better explain the features of each component and how they can be used.

### Components that need replacing
[Dropdown] The Dropdown component is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Replace it with Select or Multiselect.

[Cookie consent] The CookieConsent component has been replaced with a new version, and it needs to be manually updated.

Deprecated components needs replacing, follow Figma guide about swapping components.

### Components that need manual checking
[Headings] Line heights have been updated to improve readability. Please check that the layout does not break.

[Form components] The asterisk indicating required fields in form components like TextInput has been renewed and is now its own property. You’ll need to manually change the required indicators in layouts.

[Tag] Accessibility has been improved, and a new Link variant has been introduced. These changes do not break the old components, but it’s still better to check the updated components.

### What should I do?
1. Duplicate your current design file
In order to avoid disruptions to your workflow, it is recommended that you duplicate your project files before accepting this update. This allows you to migrate to the latest HDS Design Kit while maintaining a reference to your original file.

2. Review and accept updates
In your duplicate file, review and accept the HDS Design Kit library updates. You will see updates to three libraries which include the 

3. Find deprecated dropdown components
You can now easily highlight deprecated components. Read more in section Figma major version release process | 📣 Introduction of Figma Variables in HDS.

5. Update components & content
This update includes breaking changes to components and may require that you update content in components with breaking changes.

### How can I continue using HDS v3?
The v3 Figma library has been copied as a new file and will no longer receive updates. However, you can continue to use it by swapping to the v3 library.

Swapping libraries allows you to quickly update instances in a file to use components from another library. Follow the Figma guide to swap to the v3 library if you wish to use the previous HDS version.

### What about the Sketch library?
The Sketch library will no longer be updated and will be removed after the 4.0.0 release.

### Introduction of Figma Variables in HDS
We are excited to announce the introduction of variables in HDS. We will be implementing variables step by step, starting with a feature for all HDS designers!

#### The first one
The first variable in use is called “Deprecated”, and it’s part of the [HDS] Deprecated variable collection. This variable is used in a single component named .❌_DeprecatedIndicator, which is used to highlight deprecated components.

#### What’s great about this?
This feature allows designers to easily and quickly identify and highlight where deprecated HDS components are used on a page.

#### How to use it
Click an empty spot on the canvas or press Esc to deselect all layers.

From the Page section of the right sidebar, click

 Change variable mode.

Hover over a variable collection [HDS] Deprecated and choose a mode On. 

 

This is just the beginning of our journey to variables in the Helsinki Design System. We are eager to start implementing spacing, colour, and typography tokens. We welcome your feedback!
