# Migrate to version 4.0.0
This guide helps you to start using HDS version 4.0.0. 

## Breaking changes
This major release contains some breaking changes. Pay attention to these when you update your project to use the new version.

### Tag component rewritten

#### React
The Tag component has been rewritten and `iconStart` and `iconEnd` -properties have now been added.
Prop `size` is now a Typescript enum with proper values (`TagSize.Small` and `TagSize.Large`).
Prop `role`has been removed and the component itself handles it role.
`deleteButtonAriaLabel`, `deleteButtonProps`, `labelProps` and `srOnlyLabel` have also been removed.
There's also no separate delete-button inside the Tag in the Deletable variant.

#### Core
In Core-side also using hds-icons is now possible with classes without additional `<span>`'s.

#### Both
Theming has also been modified a bit with changed css-variable names. New design also makes slight changes to the stylings.

- <InternalLink size="M" href="/storybook/core/?path=/story/components-tag">Core storybook examples</InternalLink>

### Button component rewritten

#### React
The Button component has been rewritten and `iconLeft` and `iconRight` -properties have now been renamed as `iconStart` and `iconEnd` to support future implementation of RTL (right-to-left) languages.
`Size`, `theme` and `variant` are all now Typescript enums with proper values (used to be Types and included "default" as value).
Properties `isLoading` and `loadingText` have been removed and implementing a loading button is done by setting the Button's variant as `clear` (`ButtonVariant.Clear`), giving the Button a `<LoadingSpinner small />` as it's `iconStart` and changing the label to something that informs the user about the loading status. Also to consider is whether to add `disabled` prop or not.

#### Core
In Core-side also using hds-icons is now possible with classes without additional `<span>`'s.

Separate `ariaLabel` has been removed, replaced by using native `aria-label` -property.
Size prop is now a Typescript-enum with values `LinkSize.Small`, `LinkSize.Medium` and `LinkSize.Large`, which correspond to string values `small`, `medium` and `large`.
