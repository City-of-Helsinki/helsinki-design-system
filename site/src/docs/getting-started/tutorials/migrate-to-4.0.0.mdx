# Migrate to version 4.0.0
This guide helps you to start using HDS version 4.0.0. 

## Breaking changes
This major release contains some breaking changes. Pay attention to these when you update your project to use the new version.

### Tag component rewritten

#### React
The Tag component has been rewritten and `iconLeft` and `iconRight` -properties have now been added.
Prop `size` is now a Typescript enum with proper values (`TagSize.Small` and `TagSize.Large`).
Prop `role`has been removed and the component itself handles it role.
`deleteButtonAriaLabel`, `deleteButtonProps`, `labelProps` and `srOnlyLabel` have also been removed.
There's also no separate delete-button inside the Tag in the Deletable variant.
Theming has also been modified a bit with changed css-variable names.
In Core-side also using hds-icons is now possible with classes without additional `<span>`'s.
New design also makes slight changes to the stylings.
