# Figma basics

<LeadParagraph>If you are setting up a new design project or you are new to Figma, this tutorial will help you to get started.</LeadParagraph>

## Getting started

### What is Figma?
Figma is a design collaboration platform. It stores your design files and version history. Through version control you can always return to the original design.

Figma also allows you to collaborate with other Helsinki designers and to share your designs with developers. You can also easily browse other Helsinki design projects for inspiration and examples.

### How to download and install Figma?
Figma has both a desktop and a web app. If you are just viewing design files, you can use the web app. If you are a designer, you need to download the desktop app to edit Sketch files. You can download the app from the <ExternalLink href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/">Figma website download page</ExternalLink>. Figma is available for both Windows and macOS.

### Which Figma role do you need?
Figma has two (2) levels of access rights for creators; **View** and **Edit**. 

Users with the **View** role can browse projects and their files and view detailed design specifications. Users with the **Edit** role have the same features as the View role does but can also edit and control files as well as access to files. 

As a rule of thumb, if you need to create or edit design files in Figma, you need the Edit role.

If you already are part of the City of Helsinki organisation but missing the Edit role, ask the City of Helsinki representative of your project to contact the HDS-team. Our address is [hds@hel.fi](mailto:hds@hel.fi). HDS team members can also be reached in the <ExternalLink href="https://helsinkicity.slack.com/archives/CHCV3KTHA">#designsystem Slack channel</ExternalLink> in the City of Helsinki Slack.

## Using Figma

### How to create a new project?

To create a new project, locate the team **“All Helsinki projects”** under City of Helsinki organisation. 

<Image src="/images/getting-started/tutorials/figma-basics/figma-project-location.png" alt="Figma project location" style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', minWidth: 600, maxwidth: 915, margin: '0 auto' }} viewable/> 

On the team page, where you can view all other projects, select the "+ Project" button at the top-right corner of the screen. If you cannot see the “+ Project" button, you are most likely missing the Edit role. See the [above question "Which Figma role do you need?"](#which-figma-role-do-you-need) for more information.

<Image src="/images/getting-started/tutorials/figma-basics/figma-create-new-project.png" alt="Adding a project description in Figma" style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', minWidth: 600, maxwidth: 915, margin: '0 auto' }} viewable/>

Next, input a descriptive name for your project. 

Lastly, open your newly created project and write a description for it by selecting "Add description" in the dropdown next to your project name. It is recommended to briefly describe the goal of the project and also provide contact information of the people responsible for the design files.

Now you are ready to start using Figma and to create your first design files.

### How to use the HDS components in a project?
To be able to use HDS components in your design files, you need to link the design libraries to the file. In most cases if you are inside City of Helsinki organisation, HDS Design kit is automatically visible in your project’s libraries. If it is not to link the HDS Design kit, open the project. Browse to the Figma main menu and choose “Libraries” 

<Image src="/images/getting-started/tutorials/figma-basics/figma-main-menu.png" alt="Main menu button Figma" style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', minWidth: 600, maxwidth: 915, margin: '0 auto' }} viewable/>

In the library menu that pops up, under Helsinki Design system-team find “HDS Design kit vX.X.X” and press the “Add to file” button. 

<Image src="/images/getting-started/tutorials/figma-basics/figma-add-libraries.png" alt="Figma add Design kit library to your file" style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', minWidth: 600, maxwidth: 915, margin: '0 auto' }} viewable/>

Now HDS Design kit library is added to the project and components and styles show up in the project's “Assets” menu.

### How to use HDS components in Figma?
To use HDS components in your Figma files, in Figma open up the "Assets" menu on top of the left panel. In this menu, you can type to search HDS components or select a specific component on the left-hand panel. Double click the component or drag it to add it to your file.

If you do not see HDS components in the "Assets" menu, please make sure you have HDS Design kit library added to your file. See the [above question "How to use the HDS components in a project?"](#how-to-use-the-hds-components-in-a-project)

### How to update HDS libraries?
When HDS design libraries update, and you have used updated components in your project, you will receive a small notification "Component Updates Available" at the bottom-right corner of the Figma window. Clicking the notification opens a window in which you can review the changes the HDS has made to the components. You can also view updates in the “Assets” menu library tab.

While it is recommended to keep your HDS components updated, you can also opt-out of the specific component update if needed. This can be useful if the change is significant and your project does not have time to adapt to the change. It is always a good practice to read through the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/releases">most recent HDS changelogs in GitHub</ExternalLink> before updating. After selecting the components you wish to update, press the "Update Components" button to finish the process. Note that if you have multiple design files in your project, you may need to repeat this process to all of them.
