  Helsinki Design System (HDS) is an open-source design system built by the City of Helsinki. It consists of tools for
  development and design as well as resources and guidelines for creating user-friendly, accessible solutions for the
  city.

  Helsinki Design System is being developed and maintained by a 5-person team. The team consists of a product owner, two
  developers, and two designers. It is also very common that projects using the HDS libraries will contribute to the
  development via proposing designs, bug fixes, and new features.

  HDS components and patterns are designed to be used on mobile devices right from the start. All HDS components are fully featured both on mobile and desktop screens, meaning that features are not degraded for mobile devices.

HDS uses two (2) methods to provide components for different screen sizes. The first method is to provide responsive components that react to the changing screen size (e.g. Navigation). The second method is to provide a separate `small` variant that can be used both on mobile screens as well as on more information-heavy user interfaces.
