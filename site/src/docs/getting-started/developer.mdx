# Getting started as a Developer

<LeadParagraph>
  Helsinki Design System provides a collection of ready-made components for building accessible websites and
  applications that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language.
</LeadParagraph>

The approved implementation techniques in the City of Helsinki are **React, WordPress, and Drupal**. Currently, HDS offers implementation in HTML and React only. If your project is using WordPress or Drupal, please [refer below for more information](#wordpress-and-drupal).

## Getting started

1. Have a look at <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system">Helsinki Design System in GitHub</ExternalLink>. It is recommended to read the <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/packages/react/README.md">repository README</ExternalLink> first and then take a peek at the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/packages/react">hds-react</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/tree/master/packages/core">hds-core</ExternalLink> packages.

## Core styles

The Core package provides Helsinki brand colours, typography, and base styles as CSS styles, and variables. Basic components are also available in HDS Core.

## React components

Helsinki Design System React library provides a collection of React components for building websites and applications. Using these components will help developers to rapidly create user interfaces that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language as well as accessible and consistent in behaviour across applications.

### Using the React component library

#### Install the package

`yarn add hds-react`

#### Import components

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react";`

or

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react/components/TextInput";`

#### Server-side rendering

export const SSRGuideline = () => {
  return (
    <Link
      onClick={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        navigate('/foundation/guidelines/server-side-rendering');
      }}
      href={withPrefix('/foundation/guidelines/server-side-rendering')}>
      guideline
    </Link>
)};

Using server-side rendering? Check our <SSRGuideline /> on how to use HDS React components with server-side rendering.

## Web components

Helsinki Design System Web Components library will provide a collection of web components for building websites and applications. Using these components will help developers to rapidly create user interfaces that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language as well as accessible and consistent in behaviour across applications.

Please note that the web components library is still in its early development.

### Using the Web Components library

#### Install or include the package

If you're using a Node environment you may install the package from the npm registry:

`yarn add hds-web-components`

However, if you're planning on using the web components in a purely HTML based environment or want to use the components in your HTML files, you may just include the JS file that defines the components:

`<script src='/path/to/web-components.js'></script>`


## Supporting disabled JavaScript

JavaScript is required to be enabled in the web browser to guarantee full functionality of Helsinki city's web services. Refer to the <ExternalLink openInNewTab openInNewTabAriaLabel="Opens in a new tab" href="https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/blob/master/NOSCRIPT.md">Noscript guide</ExternalLink> on how to provide a fallback.

## WordPress and Drupal

While HDS does not currently offer WordPress or Drupal implementations, HDS cooperates with multiple WordPress and Drupal projects in the City of Helsinki. Many of these projects have already implemented HDS components which can be reused in other projects.

If your project is using either WordPress or Drupal, please contact [ketu@hel.fi](mailto:ketu@hel.fi) to learn about available implementations that follow HDS.
