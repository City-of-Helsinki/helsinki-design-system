  Helsinki Design System provides a collection of ready-made components for building accessible websites and
  applications that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language.

### Using the React component library

#### Install the package:

#### Import components:

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react";`

or

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react/components/TextInput";`

## WordPress and Drupal

While HDS does not currently offer WordPress or Drupal implementations, HDS cooperates with multiple WordPress and Drupal projects in the City of Helsinki. Many of these projects have already implemented HDS components which can be reused in other projects.

If your project is using either WordPress or Drupal, please contact [ketu@hel.fi](mailto:ketu@hel.fi) to learn about available implementations that follow HDS.
