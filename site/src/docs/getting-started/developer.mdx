# Getting started as a Developer

<LeadParagraph>
  Helsinki Design System provides a collection of ready-made components for building accessible websites and
  applications that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language.
</LeadParagraph>

The approved implementation techniques in the City of Helsinki are **React, WordPress, and Drupal**. Currently, HDS offers implementation in HTML and React only. If your project is using WordPress or Drupal, please [refer below for more information](#wordpress-and-drupal).

## React components

Helsinki Design System React library provides a collection of React components for building websites and applications. Using these components will help developers to rapidly create user interfaces that are in line with the Helsinki City Design Language as well as accessible and consistent in behaviour across applications.

### Using the React component library

#### Install the package:

`yarn add hds-react`

#### Import components:

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react";`

or

`import { TextInput } from "hds-react/components/TextInput";`

## WordPress and Drupal

While HDS does not currently offer WordPress or Drupal implementations, HDS cooperates with multiple WordPress and Drupal projects in the City of Helsinki. Many of these projects have already implemented HDS components which can be reused in other projects.

If your project is using either WordPress or Drupal, please contact [ketu@hel.fi](mailto:ketu@hel.fi) to learn about available implementations that follow HDS.
