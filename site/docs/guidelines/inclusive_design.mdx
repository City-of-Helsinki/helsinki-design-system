# Inclusivity
<StatusLabel type="alert">Draft</StatusLabel>

<LargeParagraph>
  The city of Helsinki aims to do ambitious inclusivity work to promote equality of all of its citizens. The goal is to advance equality in the city of Helsinki services and activities. This page guides how to design and develop inclusive services with Helsinki Design System.

The content of this page is based on "Towards an Equal Helsinki" document published and ratified by the City of Helsinki council. Helsinki's inclusivity work is based on equality laws, expertise, cooperation, science-based information as well as city values and strategy.

## What is inclusive design?
Inclusive design means taking into account the needs of the users who might experience exclusion in their daily lives. This exclusion may be due to being part of a specific group or minority. The goal is to intentionally include these groups to reduce the risk to unintentionally exclude them.

In Helsinki, we aim to apply inclusive design in all parts of the service development. This not only means designing, developing, testing and releasing the service, but also everything related to it such as meetings, workshops, and daily interactions with other people.

<Notification label="TLDR (Too long, didn't read)" className="siteNotification">
<b>Recognize Diversity and Uniqueness</b><br />As individuals spread out from the hypothetical average, their needs are becoming ever more diverse. Most individuals stray from the average in some facet of their needs or goals, so a mass solution won't work well for them.<br />
<br />
<b>Inclusive Process and Tools</b><br />An inclusive design team should be as diverse as possible, and include individuals with first-hand experience of the users for whom the designs are intended. In this way, we also respect the edict "nothing about us without us." without relegating people with disabilities to the role of subjects in research or tokens in design exercises.<br />
<br />
<b>Broader Beneficial Impact</b><br /> It is the responsibility of inclusive designers to understand the context and broader impact of any proposed design and to aim for a beneficial impact that extends beyond the intended recipient of the design.

## What is inclusive design?
In short, inclusive design is the practice of intentionally including the needs of users who likely experience exclusion in many aspects of their daily lives due to being part of an oppressed group or a statistical minority. If we don’t intentionally include the risk is to unintentionally exclude. 

As a UX professional (aspiring, new, or seasoned), you hold the power to shape things—to alter the nature and direction of a project. That is a tremendous responsibility, and it means that you have the ability to influence design decisions in ways that benefit people who are often overlooked or ignored. 

In fact, everyone contributing to the design of a digital product—the UXers, of course, but also software developers, product managers, and even talent acquisition professionals—is responsible for the social impact of the solutions they deliver, for the decisions they make and for those they choose not (or forget) to make. This is why understanding the scope and complexity of inclusive design is essential for aspiring tech professionals.

People with disabilities, oppressed minorities, and potentially any user (ourselves included) can and do experience exclusion when interacting with a digital product. Negative, exclusionary, and discriminatory user experiences come in many forms, including:
- Denied access
- Identity demeaning experiences
- Unwanted exposure of sensitive information (real or perceived)
- Frustrating experiences

Taking this into consideration, one way we can define an inclusive design approach is to say that it should enable the delivery of solutions that are not just easy to access, but also make people feel welcomed, safe, and valued.

## The most essential elements of inclusive design
Inclusive design happens when you have 1) the right team behind the design decisions and 2) user involvement in the design process. Let’s break down what these two foundational elements are all about.

### The right team
Whether it’s conscious or not, we’re all biased. The human tendency is to imagine that others have experiences similar to our own. This is a tendency that needs some time, intention, and exposure to people’s stories and experiences that are different from our own to change. How does this impact the design process? It means that we are often unaware of who we are leaving out of the design process.

The identities represented within a team have a huge impact on what decisions are made. As Mike Monteiro says in Ruined by Design,“All the white boys in the room, even with the best of intentions, will only ever know what it’s like to make decisions as a white boy.”

Having diverse teams helps us notice and overcome our individual biases. A product design team made up of people with different cultural backgrounds, varying abilities, and different gender identities is more powerful than a team of people who look, behave, identify, and think in the same ways. So find ways to build a diverse team that’s capable of noticing and designing solutions for a broader range of user needs.

### Involving users
UX is based on the belief that users should be the primary stakeholder, at the center of everything we do as we shape products and solutions for them. Maybe you’ve heard it before: interview users, discover their needs, test ideas with them, and listen to them once you have delivered your solution(s).

Contact with users becomes even more necessary when designing for user groups we don’t know. Design and accessibility expert Kat Holmes talks about designing with users as an essential part of the process. If we want to make sure that the experience we design delivers value to everyone who might benefit from it, we need to design with excluded communities rather than for them.

Here is where collaborative design methods and tools such as co-creation workshops and sacrificial concepts become useful.

## Inclusive design embraces accessibility standards
Often, when talking about inclusive design, the first (and sometimes only) association that people/organizations make is with accessibility. Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments that are usable by people with disabilities. While inclusive design goes beyond accessibility concerns, designing for accessibility is an integral part of designing for inclusion.

When designing websites, there are some well-known standards and guidelines you can follow to ensure that you’re not excluding users on the basis of ability—the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a great place to start.

Accessibility should be integrated fully into your inclusive design processes. Companies like Google have integrated accessibility principles seamlessly into their design language. Here’s an example of how Material Design has seamlessly woven accessibility standards into Google’s design language.

## Best practises

Inclusive design embraces accessibility, ensuring that users are not excluded because of their abilities; it extends that same effort and intention to the needs of users who are often excluded for other reasons (age, background, race, gender identity, etc.). Here are four key considerations and best practices to help you design more inclusively.

### 1. Use inclusive imagery
Representing people through icons, illustrations, and photographs requires thoughtfulness. There are two strategies to produce inclusive images: abstracting and diversifying. Neither take a great deal of effort and both can only help more users feel more included in the experiences and products you design.

### 2. Abstracting

Abstracting means departing from a realistic, detailed representation in favor of something that allows users to fit the image into their own lives and identities. You can accomplish this by using more conceptual but still human-like illustrations—or even objects or animals.

Abstracting is a great way to ensure our users will not feel excluded. The same is true when we want to represent not just one user, but a group of people who are known to them.

### 3. Diversifying

Diversifying, on the other hand, aims to represent the multitude of differences users might identify with. This strategy has been employed a lot already in advertising and is suitable for marketing websites as well as in-product imagery that doesn’t act as a direct representation of an actual user or a person they know.

When you diversify, you seek to represent the full spectrum of humanity in any imagery you use. Inclusive imagery requires good collaboration between UX and UI designers.

### 4. Write inclusive copy

Inclusive copy is all about making words work for everyone. Words are as powerful as images—or even more so. We use words to consume information, to communicate with others, and to define and express our identity. To start making your copy more inclusive, make sure to use easy language, be attentive to the words you use in forms, and write notifications wisely and consistently.

#### Easy language
Using simple words and short sentences is inclusive. This makes information more easily accessible for everyone. Complicated, infrequently used terms and endless paragraphs make things unnecessarily difficult for people with cognitive disabilities and for people that are not fluent in the language of your interface.

#### Forms
Forms designed to collect sensitive user data such as name, gender, age, etc., are still an often neglected touchpoint in terms of helping users to feel included. Here, the power and duty of the designer is that of deciding:

- Whether or not a specific question needs to be asked in the first place
- How to ask the question
- What answers to make available for users to select from

For example, let’s think of a form with a field inquiring about users’ “sex.” Before you finalize the copy, ask yourself:

- Why do we want to ask users about their sex?
- Is it necessary for us to know this?
- What do we want to do with that information?

If you conclude that there’s a good reason to ask this particular question, then reflect on how to ask the question. As you do this, take time to consider: Sex and gender are two very different things. Is it really sex that you need to know? Or is it their gender, or something else? Do you need to know what they identify with or what is on their passport?

Now, back to your form. You might list all suitable answers to this question or you might allow users to type in their answer in an open text field (or some combination of these two). Be mindful of the options you make available for users to select and make sure they are in keeping with the information you’re actually asking for.

Finally, this is an incredibly personal question for some people—consider explaining to users why you are asking and how the information will be used.

You can take a similar approach to questions about ethnicity. Just like gender, it’s a complex topic and people might define themselves using more than one word. Showing a limited set of mutually exclusive options can make them feel pretty bad (and remember that race and ethnicity don’t mean the same thing).
