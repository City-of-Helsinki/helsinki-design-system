# Inclusivity
<StatusLabel type="alert">Draft</StatusLabel>

<LargeParagraph>
  The city of Helsinki aims to do ambitious inclusivity work to promote equality of all of its citizens. The goal is to advance equality in the city of Helsinki services and activities. This page guides how to design and develop inclusive services with Helsinki Design System.
</LargeParagraph>

The content of this page is based on "Towards an Equal Helsinki" document published and ratified by the City of Helsinki council. Helsinki's inclusivity work is based on equality laws, expertise, cooperation, science-based information as well as city values and strategy. Please refer to the original document if you have questions about the inclusivity in Helsinki:

## What is inclusive design?
Inclusive design means taking into account the needs of the users who might experience exclusion in their daily lives. This exclusion may be due to being part of a specific group or minority. The goal is to intentionally include these groups to reduce the risk to unintentionally exclude them.

In Helsinki, we aim to apply inclusive design in all parts of the service development. This not only means designing, developing, testing and releasing the service, but also everything related to it such as meetings, workshops, and daily interactions with other people. 

As stated in the Helsinki equality plan, "_The most important goal of all gender equality work is to make Helsinki develop into a city where people representing all genders, gender identities and gender expressions can be seen and heard and are allowed to participate and act as equal citizens without direct or indirect discrimination_". 

## Setting up your project for success
When starting a new project, there are two (2) main elements what it comes to ensure inclusivity. 

### 1. Multidisciplinary and diverse team
The structure of your project team shapes the decision it makes. Always aim to have a multidisciplinary team and make sure your team members can work together. It is ideal if all team members are able to be part of the project right from the research and design phase all the way to the testing and release.

While it is not always possible to ensure your team is diverse enough, it is important to awknowledge the diversity of your team. In small non-diverse teams, it is important to make sure the designs and implementations are tested with a more diverse group of test users.

### 2. Involving users
<p>To create services with good user experience and accessibility, it is essential to involve real users. Plan early how you will involve real users during your project. Make sure users involved in research and user testing are chosen from people from varying backgrounds. You can find more information about research and user testing in projects in the <Link href="https://pelikirja.hel.fi/" external>Helsinki Playbook (in Finnish)</Link>.</p>

## Best practises
While designing inclusive and accessible services may seem a daunting task, it gets easier when you take it into account from the beginning of the project. Here are a list of best practises from the city of Helsinki projects.

### Imagery
Most services in Helsinki use some kind of imagery either for conveying information or adding visual intrest. Using imagery always requires some extra though to ensure all users can feel welcomed and included in your service.

If you are using photographs, make sure you intentionally diversify your images. This means ensuring that a wide array of different users are represented in your imagery.

<p>Using abstract images is another way of improving inclusiveness of your images. Instead of using realistic and detailed photographs, your project can use more conceptual illustrations. <Link href="https://brand.hel.fi/kuvitusohjeisto/" external>The Helsinki Visual identity guideline</Link> has a wide array of abstract image materials to be used in your project.</p>

### Writing copy
Using inclusive language in your service is as important as using inclusive imagery. Text often contains the most important information of your service and it is accessible to most user groups in some way or another. 

Prefer using simple words and short sentences to keep your copy as easy to understand as possible. Using infrequently used words and long sentences make the copy more difficult to understand for many people - especially if they are not fluent in the main language of your interface.

Provide your user interface in multiple languages. In general, at least Finnish, Swedish and English should be available. Depending on the users of your service you may need to consider providing other languages too.

### Making forms
Forms designed to collect sensitive user data such as name, gender, age, etc., are still an often neglected touchpoint in terms of helping users to feel included. Here, the power and duty of the designer is that of deciding:

- Whether or not a specific question needs to be asked in the first place
- How to ask the question
- What answers to make available for users to select from

For example, let’s think of a form with a field inquiring about users’ “sex.” Before you finalize the copy, ask yourself:

- Why do we want to ask users about their sex?
- Is it necessary for us to know this?
- What do we want to do with that information?

If you conclude that there’s a good reason to ask this particular question, then reflect on how to ask the question. As you do this, take time to consider: Sex and gender are two very different things. Is it really sex that you need to know? Or is it their gender, or something else? Do you need to know what they identify with or what is on their passport?

Now, back to your form. You might list all suitable answers to this question or you might allow users to type in their answer in an open text field (or some combination of these two). Be mindful of the options you make available for users to select and make sure they are in keeping with the information you’re actually asking for.

Finally, this is an incredibly personal question for some people—consider explaining to users why you are asking and how the information will be used.

You can take a similar approach to questions about ethnicity. Just like gender, it’s a complex topic and people might define themselves using more than one word. Showing a limited set of mutually exclusive options can make them feel pretty bad (and remember that race and ethnicity don’t mean the same thing).
