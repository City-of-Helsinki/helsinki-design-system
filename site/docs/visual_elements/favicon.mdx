# Favicon

<LargeParagraph>The City of Helsinki favicon is used in digital services to identify the site window or tab.</LargeParagraph>

<p>The favicon consists of the text <em>Helsinki</em> framed by the shape derived from the city crest. The favicon must be used in accordance with the <Link href="#" external>Visual Identity Guidelines - Favicon</Link>.</p>

**Do not attempt to recreate the favicon!** 
Always use the appropriate original file. 

**Note:** The City of Helsinki logo is a registered trademark.

## Principles 
Official City of Helsinki services must always show the City of Helsinki favicon: 
- sitewide, in the browser website title
- use the same favicon variant consistently

## Usage

### Contrast
The Helsinki framed favicon is primarily used in black, white, or with a transparent background depending on the circumstance.
- Check that the colour contrast of the favicon and its background is compliant with <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>AA Level contrast ratios</Link>.
- For more information, see the <Link href="https://brand.hel.fi/en/colours/" external>Visual Identity Guidelines - Colours</Link>.


## Variants
There are many variants available in HDS. They all serve a very specific purpose.
