<LargeParagraph>
  The cookie compliance pattern describes how the user is informed about the use of cookies. The pattern also offers a way to accept or decline non-essential cookies and change the consent later if needed.
</LargeParagraph>

<p>The city of Helsinki cookie pattern is based on <Link href="https://www.traficom.fi/en/regulations/guidance-use-web-cookies-service-providers" external>Traficom's cookie guidelines for service provider</Link>.</p>

## Cookie basics

### What are cookies?

### Which cookies are essential and which non-essential?

### When the consent for cookies should be asked?

## Cookie information and categorisation

The cookie consent needs to be asked when your service becomes public (even during alpha/beta periods). [Service under Hel.fi? / Service on its own?]

To prepare to use the HDS cookie compliance component, you have to:
1. List all the cookies related to your service
2. Gather all needed information for each cookie
3. Categorise cookies into predefined categories

| Cookie data      | Description        |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **Name**         |                    |
| **Host name**    |                    |
| **Path**         |                    |
| **Description**  |                    |
| **Expiration**   |                    |

| Category                        | Description                                                                                                                | Is essential?                                                                                                                                                               | Examples                                                                                  |

## Using the cookie compliance component

- Make sure that cookie consent is the first item in the page tab order.
- If your page has a chat button in lower right corner, keep the chat button hidden until cookie consent has been accepted and removed from the DOM.
- Never use an overlay behind the banner or otherwise restrict use of the site.
- Be sure to add a description about the cookie that stores information about accepted cookies.

## Editing and updating cookie consent
