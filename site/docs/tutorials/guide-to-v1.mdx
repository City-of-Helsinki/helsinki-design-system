<b>Designers:</b> Update your Sketch to version 71.

## How does this update affect my work?
The biggest change is that Helsinki Design System is now officially in production and not in beta anymore. In most cases this does not affect your work. It gives you certainty that you can use the components in your own projects. Most of the HDS components have now been marked as Stable. You can review the full list of the current components and their statuses in the [Component overview page](/components).


Moving onto production also means that HDS is part of continuous depelopment in the City of Helsinki, and the team is doing their best to provide good quality library components that help building accessible, user friendly and consistent digital services.


Design System is not done - we keep building it even further based on the needs of the community. We will pay attention to communication, providing you information early as possible on the new features and updates but also when we know that there are breaking changes coming in the future.

## How about deprecated features?
This transition to 1.0 is a major update and there are some deprecated parts that have been removed and we recommend you to pay attention to replacing those.

### Dropdown is removed, use Selection or Combobox instead (React only)
Dropdown component was split in to two different components, Select and Combobox, and old dropdown was marked deprecated in October 2020.
Dropdown component has now been removed completely. 

- **Use Select variant when**
  - there are less than 8 options
  - the user does not need to be able to filter options by typing
- **Use Combobox variant when**
  - there are 8 or more options
  - the user needs to be able to filter options by typing

### LabelText is removed, use Label instead (React only)
All of the HDS form components included a property `LabelText` to set a label for the form element. This property has not been renamed to `Label`. The `Label` property has been supported for a while and most likely your project is already using it.

### Sketch libraries have been updated to version 71
If you are using HDS Sketch design libraries, they have been updated to the Sketch version 71. To avoid any issues with mismatched versions, it is recommended to update your Sketch to the 71 version.
