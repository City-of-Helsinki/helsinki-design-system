<LargeParagraph>
  A navigation component is the main way for users to navigate and locate themselves when using a service. It includes some key features present in most services to keep user experience consistent between them.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles

- **It is strongly recommended to always include the navigation component in your service.**
- Always position navigation to the top of the page. Keep the navigation in place so the user can always easily locate it. It is recommended to include navigation on every page of the service.
- Navigation component is built to follow HDS [breakpoint tokens](/design-tokens/breakpoints). While it is recommended to follow HDS breakpoint tokens, you may alter navigation width to fit your service's needs.
- **Try to keep the order of actions (search, user, language select) consistent in navigation.** Do not change the default order without a good reason.
  - If there are less than three available languages and the services navigation is simple, available languages can be listed as links in the action row instead of a language select dropdown for better usability.
- Keep navigation menu link labels clear and concise. Prefer max 1-2 word long labels. Avoid starting multiple menu link labels with the same word.


## Accessibility

- HDS Navigation is designed to support many different brand colors. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- **When designing menu link hierarchy, always think about keyboard and screen reader users.** First, make sure top level menu labels are clear and submenu items contextually fit under it. Next, make sure menu option order is logical and reasonable. Remember that keyboard users need to manually navigate to each element and thus placing commonly used menu option last is not optimal.

## Usage and variations

### Default (2 lines)

The default navigation includes separate line for navigation menu links. Therefore it is ideal choice for most services where navigation structure is more complicated.

<Playground>
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row>
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
</Playground>

#### React code example:
```tsx
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row>
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
```

### Small (1 line)

A service can opt to use smaller, 1 line navigation if 2 line navigation is too heavy for its purpose. Smaller navigation is optimal for services that do not have complicated navigation structure (only 1-3 links in navigation) and do not need many navigation features such as search, profile and language selection.

<Playground>
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
</Playground>

#### React code example:
```tsx
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
```

### Color variations

HDS Navigation offers two variations with different background colors - one with white and one with black text elements. Use variation that achieves better contrast with the brand background colour of your choice. When customising colours, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.

<Playground>
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System" theme="black">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
</Playground>

#### React code example:
```tsx
{/* White (default) */}
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>

{/* Black */}
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System" theme="black">
  <Navigation.Row display="inline">
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
    <Navigation.Item label="Item" />
  </Navigation.Row>
</Navigation>
```

### Navigation actions

HDS Navigation component supports many commonly used features out of the box. The main navigation bar can be configured to include search, language selection and user profile actions. You may also easily customize the action row with your own actions.

<Playground>
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Actions>
    <Navigation.Search searchLabel="Search" searchPlaceholder="Search page" />
    <Navigation.User label="Sign in" />
    <Navigation.LanguageSelector
      options={[{label: 'FI'}, {label: 'SV'}, {label: 'EN'}]}
      value={{label: 'EN'}}
    />
  </Navigation.Actions>
</Navigation>
</Playground>

#### React code example:
```tsx
<Navigation title="Helsinki Design System">
  <Navigation.Actions>
    <Navigation.Search searchLabel="Search" searchPlaceholder="Search page" />
    <Navigation.User label="Sign in" />
    <Navigation.LanguageSelector
      options={[{label: 'FI'}, {label: 'SV'}, {label: 'EN'}]}
      value={{label: 'EN'}}
    />
  </Navigation.Actions>
</Navigation>
```
