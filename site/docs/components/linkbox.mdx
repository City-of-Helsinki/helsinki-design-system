# Linkbox

<LargeParagraph>
    Linkboxes are used to combine multiple elements into a single interactable element. While they are visually similar to HDS Cards, Linkboxes are always a single clickable link and they cannot contain other interactable elements.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- **Linkbox must always be interactable in its entirety.** This means that Linkboxes must not include multiple interactable elements (e.g. buttons or multiple links). The Linkbox element only gets focused once.
- To emphasize its interactability, the Linkbox includes a mandatory icon. Depending on the link type the icon is either an arrow or external link icon. Do not remove or modify these icons.
      - To read more about HDS recommendations about links, see [HDS Link documentation]().
- **Linkboxes work very well for listing heterogenous content** such as news items, blog posts, or upcoming events.
- **Use Linkboxes sparingly.** While they can drastically improve service's understandability and readability, overusing them may result in confusing and complex user interfaces.

### Should I use a Linkbox or a Card?
- **Use the Linkbox component when**
  - the whole element needs to be interactable
  - the element does not include multiple interactable elements
- **Use the [Card component](/components/card) when**
  - the whole Card does not need to be interactable
  - the Card contains multiple interactable elements (e.g. buttons or links)

## Accessibility
- Linkbox must have either a visual heading or `aria-label` as a title. This describes the Linkbox's content for assistive technologies.
- Linkbox must have the link as its last element (in the DOM tree). This way assistive technologies will eventually find the Linkbox link.
- The colour contrast between the Linkbox and its background must comply with <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>WCAG AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. If needed, you may use a Linkbox border to increase the contrast to its background.

## Usage & variations

### Empty
The default empty Linkbox variant can be used to build Linkboxes with custom content. Use the property `external` to alter the icon depending on the link type.
