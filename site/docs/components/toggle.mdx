# Toggle button

<StatusLabel type="alert">Draft</StatusLabel>
<StatusLabel type="success" style={{marginLeft: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}}>Accessible</StatusLabel>

<LargeParagraph>
  Toggle button allows the user to switch between two distinct states such as "On" and "Off".
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles

- **A label should always be provided with a toggle button.** 
  - Make sure that the label is clear and concise. A good toggle button label describes the effect that will happen when the toggle button is set to "On" position.
  - For example, use a label "_Allow notifications_" instead of "_Do you want to receive notifications?_".
- The toggle button should have immediate effect when activated.
  - Toggle buttons have been inspired by real world physical switches (e.g. a light switch). Therefore users expect something to happen immediately when the toggle button is activated.
  - Toggle buttons must not be used in forms that require pressing a submit button in order to the selection come into effect - unless they have an immediate effect inside the form.
  - If your toggle button does not have immediate effect, use a single [Checkbox component](/components/checkbox) instead.
- Toggle button will always have a default option. "Empty state" toggle buttons must not be used.

## Accessibility

- **It is advisable to use colour combinations provided by the implementation.** These combinations are ensured to comply with WCAG AA requirements. When customising colors, refer to [colour guidelines](/design-tokens/colour "Colour") to ensure accessibility.
- If the toggle button makes other elements appear on the view, those elements should be located next to the toggle button - preferably right after or below it.
  - While not recommended, if a toggle button makes elements appear in other parts of the user interface, you need to make sure to notify assistive technologies about the change. You can use [HDS Notification component](/components/notification) for this purpose.
- HDS Toggle button includes a small animation when the toggle state is changed. However, the animation is considered non-decorative and therefore it does not have to be able to be disabled. See <Link href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html" external>WCAG 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions guideline</Link> for more information.

### Toggle button with a horizontal label
The toggle button label can also be positioned horizontally. This alignment is often used on smaller screens (e.g. mobile phones) and tighter user interface spaces.
