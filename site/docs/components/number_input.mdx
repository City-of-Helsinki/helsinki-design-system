  A number input allows the user to enter numeric values. It also features optional steppers for increasing or decreasing the value by a set amount.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- **A label should always be provided with a number input.**
    - Make sure that the label is clear and concise. The user should immediately understand what number they are supposed to input.
- HDS Number input also supports displaying an unit for the number. Displaying the unit is not mandatory. Only use it when you think it will help the user.
    - Display the unit for SI units (such as meters) and currencies
    - The unit does not need to be displayed when it is self-evident for the user, such as in "Number of people"
- It is recommended to give the number input a default value.
- HDS Number input supports visual steppers which can be set to increase and decrease the number value by a set amount.
    - Steppers can be used when changes to the value are small or when they are intuitive to the user (e.g. from 0 to 100 with steps of 10).
    - You should not use steppers when large value changes are expected.

## Accessibility
- HDS number input allows the user to input the date manually without using stepper actions. Whenever you require the user to input numbers, you should also allow the manual input.
- If steppers are used, provide descriptive aria labels for both increase and decrease actions.
- If the number needs to follow a specific format, remember to specify it in the assistive text.

## Usage and variations

### Default number input
Default HDS Number input comes without stepper. The number is always inputted manually. Using this over a text input is still helpful since it has a `type=number` to aid screen readers and mobile keyboards.

### Number input without steppers
Steppers can be enabled via a property. Use this variant when value changes are small and you can determine logical amounts for increase and decrease steps.
