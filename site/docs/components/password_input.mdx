<LargeParagraph>
    A password field is a foundational input field component that the user can interact with and specifically input password data.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- A label should always be provided with password fields.
- If possible, allow the password input to reflect the strength of the password entered.
- If possible, add other programmatic assistance. Detect and suggest changes to provide the user with assistance in generating strong passwords.
- If possible, do input validation in client-side real-time and provide the user with immediate feedback. See HDS Form validation pattern page for more information and best practises with password fields.
- Password fields should always be mandatory and it is recommended to mark it as a required field.
- Use `autocomplete="new-password"` and `id="new-password"` for the password input in a sign-up form, and for the new password in a reset-password form.
- Provide functionality to mask/unmask the password.
- Use `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for password inputs.
- Don't double-up; Instead, it's better to enable users to confirm their email address.

## Accessibility
- Use element attributes to access browser features: type, name, autocomplete, required, autofocus.
- Place sign-in in its own `form` element.
- Ensure the successful form submission
