<LargeParagraph>
    A password field is a foundational input field component that the user can interact with and specifically input password data.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- A label should always be provided with password fields.
- If possible, allow the password input to reflect the strength of the password entered.
- If possible, add other programmatic assistance. Detect and suggest changes to provide the user with assistance in generating strong passwords.
- If possible, do input validation in client-side real-time and provide the user with immediate feedback. See HDS Form validation pattern page for more information and best practices with password fields.
- Password fields should always be mandatory and it is recommended to mark it as a required field.
- Use `autocomplete="new-password"` and `id="new-password"` for the password input in a sign-up form, and for the new password in a reset-password form.
- Provide functionality to mask/unmask the password.
- Use `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for password inputs.
- Don't double-up; Instead, it's better to enable users to confirm their email addresses.

## Accessibility
- Use element attributes to access browser features: type, name, autocomplete, required, autofocus.
- Place sign-in in its own `form` element.
- Ensure the successful form submission

## Security
As HDS password input provides only the front-end solution, remember that you need to take care of the security in your project.
Here are some good practices you need to consider.

### General Security
- Do not prevent the user from copying and pasting the password into the field
- Prefer using ready authentication libraries and services, and familiarize yourself properly with their implementation
- Never store the password in a readable form. Always use proper hash algorithms.
- Always protect the communication with secure connections (TLS 1.2 or newer)
- Encourage usage of multi-factor authentication and password managers

### Creating a new password
- Inform user properly what are the requirements for their password
- Do not accept password matching user identifier e.g. username or email
- Do not truncate, sanitize, or format in any way password user has given
- Set minimum length for password 12 to 16 characters
- Avoid setting a maximum password length smaller than 128 characters

### Using password to log in
- In an error message, you should not declare whether the username or the password is wrong but give general instructions to fix the problem.
