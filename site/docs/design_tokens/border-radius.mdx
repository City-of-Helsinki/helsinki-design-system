# Border radius

<LargeParagraph>The border-radius tokens are used to control element's corners.</LargeParagraph>

The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer edge. The radius applies to the background element, even if the element has no border.

## Principles

When creating components or editing existing ones, keep in mind, that rounded corners, whether small or big, **should never be applied to any part of the Helsinki brand assets**. 
Border radius is only reserved for specific user interface needs. **Rounding should never be used as a mere stylization.** 

## Usage

### When to use

- **To make a distinction between buttons and tags vs. keywords.**
- **With elements that traditionally use rounding, E.g. media controls.**
- **When emphasizing human communication, E.g. in chat speech bubbles.**
- **Visual distinction from the surrounding elements is needed.** As humans, we are conditioned to favor rounded corners, while sharp corners invoke a feeling of danger.
- **When designing for a very young demographic.** As children, we quickly learn that sharp corners hurt and that rounded corners are safer.
- **Reproducing natural or some cultural connotations.** Rounded corners can be found everywhere in nature and humans have – throughout history – tried to replicate shapes found in nature.


### When not to use

- **Oversaturating your design with rounded corners isn’t a good idea**, unless you’re designing for a very young demographic. When to use rounded corners depends on the emotions that you want your users to experience.
- **In buttons or form fields.** 
- **In any brand provided assets.** 
- **When you can not justify a real need for rounded corners.**

## Sizing

**By length**

Denotes the size of the circle radius, or the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, using length values. Negative values are invalid.

**By percentage**

Denotes the size of the circle radius, or the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, using percentage values. Percentages for the horizontal axis refer to the width of the box; percentages for the vertical axis refer to the height of the box. Negative values are invalid.

## Tokens
The HDS border radius tokens are divided in three for different uses:

- **Sharp** is used as default in most elements. 
- **Slight** is used for rectangular objects that require slight rounding.
- **Circle** is used to allow circular objects.
