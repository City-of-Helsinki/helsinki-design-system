# Breakpoints

<LargeParagraph>
    Breakpoint tokens are used to keep services and products using HDS consistent across all screen sizes.
</LargeParagraph>

HDS includes tokenized values for both breakpoints and maximum container width in each breakpoint. Breakpoint tokens can be also used alongside [HDS grid guidelines](/guidelines/grid) in order to create consistent designs and implementations.

## Principles
- **Always use token of the same level for both the breakpoint and container width**. This ensures consistency across all services using HDS breakpoint tokens. Read more about this in [breakpoint usage](/design-tokens/breakpoints#usage).
- **Aim to provide all breakpoints listed in HDS tokens in your service.** This way you ensure your service is usable with every common screen width. 
- For best results, test your designs and implementations **at the edge** of each HDS breakpoint.
- It is recommended to use scaling methods HDS suggests for each breakpoint (see [Breakpoints token table](/design-tokens/breakpoints#breakpoints-1)). However, it is allowed to use different scaling methods if it works better for the service.


## Accessibility
- When testing your designs and implementation at different breakpoints, pay extra attention how your service behaves if browser zoom functionality is used.

## Usage
The breakpoint tokens are divided into two sets;
- **Breakpoint tokens** define exact widths (in pixels) where the next breakpoint comes into effect. 
- **Container width tokens** define maximum container width in each breakpoint.

**Note how these two sets of tokens are linked.** You are supposed pick and use tokens from same level depending on the screen width. For example, when screen width is above 767 pixels and below 992 pixels you use `--breakpoint-m` token in combination with `--container-width-m` token.


## Tokens
### Breakpoints
CSS             | SASS           | px value | Scaling method
----------------|----------------|----------|----------------------
--breakpoint-xs | $breakpoint-xs | ≥ 320    | Scale columns
--breakpoint-s  | $breakpoint-s  | ≥ 576    | Scale outside margins
--breakpoint-m  | $breakpoint-m  | ≥ 768    | Scale outside margins
--breakpoint-l  | $breakpoint-l  | ≥ 992    | Scale outside margins
--breakpoint-xl | $breakpoint-xl | ≥ 1248   | Scale outside margins

### Maximum container widths
CSS                  | SASS                | px value
---------------------|---------------------|---------
--container-width-xs | $container-width-xs | 288
--container-width-s  | $container-width-s  | 544
--container-width-m  | $container-width-m  | 720
--container-width-l  | $container-width-l  | 944
--container-width-xl | $container-width-xl | 1200
