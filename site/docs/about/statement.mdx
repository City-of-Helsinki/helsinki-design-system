# Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to the website Helsinki Design System (documentation). The site address is [hds.hel.fi](http://hds.hel.fi).

### Statutory provisions applicable to the website
This website was published after 23.09.2018. The website must fulfil statutory accessibility requirements.

### The objective of the city
As regards the accessibility of digital services, Helsinki aims to reach at least Level AA or above as set forth in the WCAG guidelines in so far as is reasonably practical.

### Compliance status
The accessibility compliance of this website was evualuated by a third party auditor on 18.9.2020. Most of the critical issues noted in the audit were fixed. However, due to the technical limitations of the website framework, not all issues were possible to be currently fixed. We are looking to change the website framework before the 1.0 release of Helsinki Design System. This upgrade will allow us to fix the rest of the issues.
