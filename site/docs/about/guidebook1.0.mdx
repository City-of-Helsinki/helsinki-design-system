# HDS guide for start using version 1.0

<LargeParagraph>
    Here you will find some useful information to make your transition to HDS 1.0 as smooth as possible.
</LargeParagraph>

## How does this affect my work?
The biggest change is that Helsinki Design System is now officially in production and not in beta anymore. In most cases this does not affect your work. It only gives you more 


This means HDS is part of continuous depelopment in the City of Helsinki, and the team is doing their best to provide good quality library components that help building accessible, user friendly and consistent digital services.


Design System is not done, we keep building it even further based on the needs of the community. 
We will pay attention to communication, providing you information early as possible on the new features and updates, but also when we know that there are breaking changes coming in the future.

## How about deprecated features?

This transition to 1.0 is a major update and there are some deprecated parts that have been removed and we recommend you to pay attention to replacing those.

### Dropdown is removed, use Selection or Combobox instead

***Should I use Select or Combobox?***
Dropdown component was split in to two different components, Select and Combobox, and old dropdown was marked deprecated in October 2020.
Now the Dropdown is removed completely.

Use Select variant when
- there are less than 8 options
- the user does not need to be able to filter options by typing   

Use Combobox variant when
- there are 8 or more options
- the user needs to be able to filter options by typing

### LabelText is removed, use Label instead

## Can I contribute to HDS work?
We appreciate all contributions you might have to help us build Helsinki Design System even better.

You can:
- suggest enhancements and new components or features
- report bugs you have encountered
- offer ready designs
- offer ready implementations
