# Icons

---

**A distinct icon style** has been originally created for Helsinki as part of defining the brand. The icon style is based on the Helsinki framed logo and the design language of the wave motif. Here are some examples from the icon library.

Some icons have been added to the icon library additionally to the ones defined in the brand work, to make it easier to create easily understandable user interfaces.

The icons may be used as part of the user interfaces, for example in buttons or navigation.
