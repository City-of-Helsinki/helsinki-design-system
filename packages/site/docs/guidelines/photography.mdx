# Photographs

**Using photographs** in your user interface can make your service to stand out and to make it feel nice and humane. The starting point for the Helsinki imagery are people and emotion: what can be experienced and felt in Helsinki. We show the true everyday Helsinki and the good everyday life of the Helsinki resident: people, working together, rejoice and funny details.

Photographs can be used as parts of the user interfaces for example in hero elements, in text+photo modules or in card components.
