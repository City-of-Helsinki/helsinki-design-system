# Spacing

---

The spacing scale is based on our typographic scale. The values defined here are used for positioning elements in the user interfaces.   
  
Multiplying and dividing these values is allowed using even numbers.  
  
With spacing of elements it is possible to create a hierarchy in the user interfaces. Notice that elements with more spacing around them tend to perceive higher importance than elements that have less space around them.  
  
Group elements together to be seen as a unit with smaller spacing.   
  
Empty space is also important in design. It can be used to separate sections on a page to create a focus to certain elements. Too dense information can be hard to digest for a user, so make sure to leave enough space in the user interfaces.
