# Text Fields

---

A text field is an input field that the user can interact with and input content and data. This component can be used for long and short form entries.
It has a range of options and supports several text formats including numbers.
Text fields are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal or search. Common text input types include: usernames, descriptions, URLs, emails, addresses, and plain text searches.

## General guidelines

Allow the text input to reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter.

- _Text input:_ When a single line of text is expected.
- _Text area:_ When the input is more than one sentence.

Where possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill inputs to reduce errors and save time. Use sentence-case for default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.

## Best practises

Text fields should:

- be clear with a meaningful label, 1-3 word
- be labeled as _optional_ when something is not required
- only ask for information which is really needed

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <TextInput
    labelText="label"
    placeholder="placeholder text"
    helperText="helper text"
  />
</Playground>

## Content

1. Label: Should indicate what sort of information the field requires and should be short and concise. Put labels directly above their input and align them to the left.
2. Placeholder text: Provides hints or examples of what to enter. Placeholder text disappears after the user begins entering data into the input and should not contain crucial information.
3. Helper text: Gives context about a field's input.
4. Validation marker: Warns in case the input value isnâ€™t valid.
