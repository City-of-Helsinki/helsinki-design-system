# Koros

---

Koros, also known as Wave motifs, are part of the visual identity of City of Helsinki, acting as graphic elements, which have been inspired by the Helsinki City crest. The wave motifs express the attitude established in the brand strategy: “One Hel of an Impact”. There are six kinds of them. An added visual interest is brought to the identity by means of the Koros. Using Koros adds high visual impact and makes the user interface recognizable as part of Helsinki city services. 

The Koros can be used, for example as part of the hero image, as part of the footer, and as a divider of content in the user interface.
