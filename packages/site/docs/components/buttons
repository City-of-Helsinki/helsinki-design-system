# Buttons

---

Buttons allow an application to communicate action and direct user intent.



## Styles
There are different kinds of buttons in the buttons library:

Primary
Secondary
Supplementary
(pictures here)


### Primary button
Directs the user’s attention to the primary action the application is suggesting that the user take. The solid background color as a visual style is used to highlight the most important actions. To avoid confusing users, don’t use more than one primary button within a section or view.

### Secondary button
Provides a lighter weight button style. They are used to indicate a secondary action that compliments a primary action or to reduce visual noise when there are many actions of equal importance on the page.

### Supplementary button
Is used in multiple scenarios. They are used as tertiary buttons. They can be used for example inside components, like cards or such.  

The buttons come in two sizes; default and small. They can be also used with icons inside them.

### Using color in buttons
Choose the primary button color by determining your main user interface colors from the brand colors. Use the primary button color also as secondary button color (border and text color). In supplementary button, the text color (and icon if used) is the same as the one used in primary and secondary buttons.

When using strong brand colors in the user interface, you can use the button color based on the background color, since not all of the colors make the content accessible (see page template examples)

## Grouping of buttons
(Here use example pictures. Some pictures can be found as exportable from Abstract: buttons library)

### Constrained content:
A modal, card element or such and buttons are aligned to right, but horizontally next to each other: primary on right, secondary on left

### Unconstrained content:
Buttons aligned to left, but horizontally next to each other: primary on left, secondary on right.

### Narrow content
Buttons aligned vertically on top of each other: primary on top, secondary below.

### Call to action
Do not use generic language that is not related to the action and not relating to the intent of the user. Use clear call to actions that also describes what can be found, or will happen after the user clicks the button.
