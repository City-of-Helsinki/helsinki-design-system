## You can contribute content in different ways.

### Editing pages

The easiest way to edit a page is with the Edit this page on Github link that appears at the bottom of every page on the site. The link opens the specific Github page where you can edit the content and propose the change with a pull request.

### Regular content updates

If you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates, you will want to fork the repo and install some of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier workflow for you long term.

### Content and style guidelines

Before you get started, take a moment to review our content guidelines. Follow these to ensure consistency of experience across all services.

### Use Markdown

The website is written in Markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute content in a systematic way. If you donâ€™t already have a Markdown editor installed, there are plenty of free editors available online.
